        <h1>OpendTect</h1>
        <h2>Windows</h2>
        <p>OpendTect, the dGB&#160;Commercial plugins, Python packages and offline User documentation and dGB&#160;Plugins documentation can be installed via the OpendTect Installation Manager (OpendTect_Installer_win64.exe) or via an offline package.</p>
        <p>There are some improvements in the installation manager:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installation packages are now grouped, e.g. all Python related packages are listed in group Python</li>
            <li>After installation the Windows&#160;Firewall rules can be set or unset.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Installation via Installation Manager</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The Installation Manager is available for download via the appropriate platform link on the <a href="https://dgbes.com/index.php/download" target="_blank">download page</a> of the dGB website.<br /><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/installation-download-installer.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect download page</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>The Installation Manager is a wizard to install/update the existing OpendTect (Current / Previous/ Legacy) releases. The release type field is used to select the release that is needed to be installed/updated. The installer gives you the choices as seen below:<br />[figure]<br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect Installation Manager</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>If it is a fresh installation then you may keep the proposed installation base directory or choose your own. If it is an update then select it's installation base directory. Now click Proceed.</li>
            <li>Select the package type of OpendTect you want to install. To read more about OpendTect packages types, please refer to our webpage of licensing types.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/installation-package-selection.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect Installer Package Selection window</small><br /></li>
            <li>The OpendTect Installation Manager identifies the platform on which it is running. This information is then anonymized prior to it being sent to OpendTect. We use this anonymous data solely for the purpose of getting a picture of OpendTect usage and thus improving our support capabilities.</li>
            <li>The next window of the wizard is the OpendTect Package&#160;Manager. Multiple items can be toggled on or off by checking the boxes. Optionally, the relevant package combination could also be selected from the top list box.
<br />[Figure]	<br /><small>Figure: OpendTect Package Manager</small></li>
            <li>The installation manager will automatically recognize the previously installed version at the selected path and will prompt it in the <i>Installed version</i> field.
				To read more about a particular item in the list, select the item by clicking on it and
			read the description on to the right panel. For example, Dip-Steering:<br />[Figure]<small><br />Figure:&#160;Dip-Steering information in right panel of OpendTect Installation Manager</small></li>
            <li>If, for any reason, you should choose to abort the installation mid-download, you
				will see the following window appear:
			<br />[Figure]<br /><small>Figure: Stopped accessing</small><br />This gives you various options, including increasing the time-out from its default setting, changing the download server or changing the Proxy settings.<br /></li>
            <li>After installation is finished the Add/Remove Firewall Program Rule window appears. This window will add rules for a selection of OpendTect's and Python executables to the Windows Firewall. For more information please see the Firewall rules and ports subchapter.<br /><img src="../Resources/Images/installation-add-remove-firewall-rule.png" /><br /><small>Figure: Add/Remove Firewall Program&#160;Rule</small><br /></li>
            <br />
            <br />
        </ol>
        <h3>Firewall rules and ports</h3>
        <p>The installer will ask to add firewall rules to the Windows Firewall. Which .exe programs it adds to Windows&#160;Firewall depends on which packages have been installed. Here is the full list of .exe files that require a rule in the Inbound Rules in the Windows Firewall:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\6.6.0\bin\win64\Release\od_main.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\6.6.0\bin\win64\Release\od_SeisMMBatch.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\6.6.0\bin\win64\Release\od_remoteservice.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\6.6.0\v7\bin\win64\Release\od_deeplearning_cc.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\Python\python.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\Python\envs\odmlpython-cpu-mkl\python.exe</li>
            <li>%OpendTectDir%\Python\envs\odmlpython-cuda10\python.exe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OpendTect will need to open ports on the localhost for Batch Processing and Machine Learning. As default OpendTect starts with port 20050 and for every service try to use the next free one. Therefore it is best to reserve the ports 20050 up to 20070 for OpendTect.</p>
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p>OpendTect, the dGB&#160;Commercial plugins, Python packages and offline User documentation and dGB&#160;Plugins documentation can be installed via the OpendTect Installation Manager (OpendTect_Installer_lux64.sh) or via an offline package.</p>
