        <h1>Petrel* Plugin</h1>
        <h2>Installing the PIP file</h2>
        <p>The plugin can be installed to Petrel* with the help of the PIP file in the usual way, where you have to use the Plugin manager tool from the menu:&#160;File -&gt;&#160;Options -&gt; Plugin manager. Press 'Install plugin' and select the downloaded&#160;PIP file. After installation restart Petrel* to activate the plugin.</p>
        <p>In order to install the updated version of the plugin, please remove the old one from the Petrel* plugin manager. Then restart Petrel* and install the plugin as described above.</p>
        <p>The PIP files can be downloaded on the OpendTect download page.</p>
        <h2>Choosing the preferred Communication Port (TCP/IP)</h2>
        <p>By default the plugin should use the TCP/IP port 57375; in case this port is not available / accessible it can be changed in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From plugin user interface, which is available under the 'Seismic interpretation' tab in the Petrel*&#160;ribbon.</li>
        </ul>
