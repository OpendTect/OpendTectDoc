        <h1>Installing OpendTect on Mac OS X</h1>
        <p>OpendTect, the dGB&#160;Commercial plugins, Python packages and offline User documentation and dGB&#160;Plugins documentation can be installed via the OpendTect Installation Manager (OpendTect_Installer_mac.dmg) or via an offline package.</p>
        <p>There are some improvements in the installation manager:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installation packages are now grouped, e.g. all Python related packages are listed in group Python</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Security setting</h2>
        <p>Please do the following before installation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the 'Apple' button (top left), go to:</li>
            <li>System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General Tab</li>
            <li>In case the option is there then toggle on <i>Allow apps to be installed from anywhere</i>, this may ask for admin credentials.</li>
            <li>The option <i>Allow apps to be installed from anywhere</i> will not be there in recent Mac OS&#160;X versions. In that case the first time you run the OpendTect installer it will not be allowed to run. first time you run the OpendTect installer there will appear an option to trust the OpendTect installer when running the installer. Please do so when this option appears.</li>
            <li>Then run the installer. If the installer is not allowed to run then go into the above mentioned Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General Tab and look for a mention about the OpendTect Installer. If it is there then choose to allow it to run. </li>
            <li>Once the installation is finished, and assuming you made a change to the security setting then you may change the security back.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>The Installation Manager is a wizard to install/update the existing OpendTect (Current / Preview) releases.
