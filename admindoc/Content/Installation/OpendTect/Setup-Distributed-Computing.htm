        <h1>Setup Distributed Computing</h1>
        <p>In order to utilize OpendTect's capability for Multi-Machine Processing (MMP), a <i>BatchHosts</i> file must be created and used. This file contains the list of remote machines (<i>host machines</i> or <i>nodes</i>) and some relevant details about these machines and the path to the Survey Data Root. OpendTect will use this file to communicate to the remote hosts and launch processes remotely on them. Follow the example format (shown below) to add the list of remote machines and their details in the respective fields.</p>
        <p>In order to minimize complications, the Setup Distributed Computing tool (formerly known as Setup Batch Processing tool) (<b>Start OpendTect as ADMIN</b>) can be used to create a tailor-made BatchHosts file (via <i>Utilities &gt; Installation &gt; Setup Distributed Computing</i>...):</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>BatchHosts file</b>: This field is not editable in the User Interface. It is set as environment variable DTECT_BATCH_HOSTS_FILEPATH. <br /></p>
        <p><b>IP address</b>: IP address of the node machine(s)</p>
        <p><b>Hostname</b>: Hostname of the node machine(s)</p>
        <p><b>Display name</b>: Free-text field. Text entered here appears in the Multi-Machine Processing window.</p>
        <p><b>Platform</b>: Select platform type.</p>
        <p><b>Survey data root</b>: Location of the survey (the path to the survey data root folder</p>
        <p>from the host machine)</p>
        <p><b>Advanced Settings</b>: Here you may change the first port value (in the case that it is blocked or in use). Linux users may decide to change the shell command from the default ssh to rsh. The Nice level sets the priority on the host machines, 19 being nicest and 1 being least nice). Finally, the Default Data Root can be set per platform:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Description of icons:</p>
        <p><b>Add</b> new host.</p>
        <p><b>Remove</b> selected host.</p>
        <p><b>Move</b> host up or down.</p>
        <p><b>Test hosts</b>. Will perform tests to ensure that the server and nodes can communicate to the necessary extent to perform the MMP. (ie: can the nodes find the data root folder and read/write into it)</p>
