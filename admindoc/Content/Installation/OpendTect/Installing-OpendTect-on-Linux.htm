        <h1>Installing OpendTect on Linux</h1>
        <p>OpendTect, the dGB&#160;Commercial plugins, Python packages and offline User documentation and dGB&#160;Plugins documentation can be installed via the OpendTect Installation Manager (OpendTect_Installer_lux64.sh) or via an offline package.</p>
        <p>There are some improvements in the installation manager:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installation packages are now grouped, e.g. all Python related packages are listed in group Python</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Installation via Installation Manager</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The Installation Manager is available for download via the appropriate platform link on the <a href="https://dgbes.com/index.php/download" target="_blank">download page</a> of the dGB website.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-download-installer-windows.png" style="width: 828px;height: 544px;" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect download page</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>After downloading the installer open a terminal window.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>In the terminal window change the directory to the directory where the installer has been downloaded to.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>Then run <code>sh OpendTect_Installer_lux64.sh</code><br /><br /></li>
            <li>This should unpack the OpendTect Installer into the /tmp directory and then run the Installer.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The Installation Manager is a wizard to install/update the existing OpendTect (Current / Preview) releases. The release type field is used to select the release that is needed to be installed/updated. The installer gives you the choices as seen below:<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-manager-64-linux.png" style="width: 533px;height: 245px;" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect Installation Manager</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>If it is a fresh installation then you may keep the proposed installation base directory or choose your own. If it is an update then select it's installation base directory. Now click Proceed.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>Select the package type of OpendTect you want to install. To read more about OpendTect packages types, please refer to our <a href="https://dgbes.com/index.php/software#licenses" target="_blank">webpage of licensing types</a>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-package-selection-complete-linux.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;OpendTect Installer Package Selection window</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>The OpendTect Installation Manager identifies the platform on which it is running. This information is then anonymized prior to it being sent to OpendTect. We use this anonymous data solely for the purpose of getting a picture of OpendTect usage and thus improving our support capabilities.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The next window of the wizard is the OpendTect Package&#160;Manager. Multiple items can be toggled on or off by checking the boxes. Optionally, the relevant package combination could also be selected from the top list box.
<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-package-manager-64-linux.png" style="width: 788px;height: 509px;" /><br /><small>Figure: OpendTect Package Manager</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>The installation manager will automatically recognize the previously installed version at the selected path and will prompt it in the <i>Installed version</i> field.
				To read more about a particular item in the list, select the item by clicking on it and
			read the description on to the right panel. For example, Machine Learning:<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-manager-right-panel-ml-linux.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;Machine Learning information in right panel of OpendTect Installation Manager</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>Please note:&#160;In order to get an out of the box experience with the Machine Learning plugin it is easiest to select all Python packages. If you know for certain that you will only process on CPU or Nvidia GPU then select either the Math Kernel Library (MKL) Python environment or the CUDA 10 Python environment. The base Python environment will always be installed.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>After selecting the packages for installation click on Proceed to start the installation. You will first get a window that downloads the files from the download server. After downloading the packages they will be unpacked to the installation path.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-downloading-files-linux.png" /> <img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-archive-unpacker-linux.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;Example of downloading files and archive unpacker windows</small><br /><br /></li>
            <li>If, for any reason, you should choose to abort the installation mid-download, you
				will see the following window appear:
<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-stopped-accessing-linux.png" /><br /><small>Figure:&#160;Stopped accessing download.opendtect.org</small><br /><br />This gives you various options, including increasing the time-out from its default setting, changing the download server or changing the Proxy settings.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>The installation will finish with giving an overview of the installed packages.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/installation-installed-information-linux.png" /><![CDATA[	]]><br /><small>Figure:&#160;Overview of installed packages</small><![CDATA[		]]></li>
        </ol>
        <p>OpendTect will need to open ports on the localhost for Batch Processing and Machine Learning. As default OpendTect starts with port 20050 and for every service try to use the next free one. Therefore it is best to reserve the ports 20050 up to 20070 for OpendTect.</p>
        <h2>Installer logging</h2>
        <p>The installer logs to a logfile. If something goes wrong during installation please look into the following files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>/tmp/username_od_instmgr_install_log.txt</li>
            <li>/tmp/username_od_instmgr_updcheck_log.txt</li>
        </ul>
