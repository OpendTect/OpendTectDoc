        <h1>Installing OpendTect on Linux</h1>
        <p>OpendTect, the dGB&#160;Commercial plugins, Python packages and offline User documentation and dGB&#160;Plugins documentation can be installed via the OpendTect Installation Manager (OpendTect_Installer_lux64.sh) or via an offline package.</p>
        <p>OpendTect will need to open ports on the localhost for Batch Processing and Machine Learning. As default OpendTect starts with port 20050 and for every service try to use the next free one. Therefore it is best to reserve the ports 20050 up to 20070 for OpendTect.</p>
