        <h1>Setup the preferred GPU with NVIDIA&#160;Control Panel</h1>
        <p> Laptops with an Intel CPU usually come with two integrated graphic cards.&#160;The default one the laptop starts up with would be one such as Intel HD graphics. OpendTect however will have the best performance when using the Nvidia GPU. Therefore that one should be used instead.</p>
        <p>When OpendTect starts it will scan your graphics card. If it finds an Intel card there will be a message: 'Intel card found. If your computer has multiple graphics cards, consider switching from the integrated graphics.'</p>
        <p>On Windows the Nvidia GPU can be made the preferred GPU with the NVIDIA&#160;Control Panel. We assume that you have installed the latest Nvidia driver that is available for your GPU. If not then please go to the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/drivers">Nvidia website</a> and download and install the latest driver for your type of GPU. </p>
        <p>Please do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search for NVIDIA Control Panel</li>
            <li>Launch the NVIDIA&#160;Control Panel</li>
            <li>In the toolbar on the left choose Manage 3D&#160;settings</li>
            <li>At Tab Program Settings click the Add button</li>
            <li>In the new window it should show you OpendTect as a recently used application. Select it and click on Add Selected Program.</li>
            <li>Select the preferred graphics processor:&#160;High-performance NVIDIA processor.</li>
            <li>Click Apply to confirm the OpendTect program customization.</li>
            <li>The next time you start OpendTect it should no longer show the Intel card found message popup. To check the graphics card used in OpendTect you might want to check Utilities &gt;&#160;Installation &gt;&#160;Graphics Information. It should now show the Nvidia card information and driver version.</li>
        </ol>
