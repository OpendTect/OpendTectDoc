        <h1>Linux</h1>
        <h2>Minimum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modern Linux distro</b>. <ul><li>&#160;We have tested:<ul><li>RedHat/CentOS 6.0 and higer</li><li>Ubuntu 16.04 and higher</li><li>OpenSUSE Leap 42.1 and higher</li></ul></li><li>Other distros will probably work, possibly with as small tweak</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>CPU</b>: Intel/AMD processor with 64 bit support</li>
            <li><b>GPU</b>: Nvidia (e.g. recent GeForce/Quadro/NVS series) graphics cards; AMD graphics cards may work</li>
            <li><b>Memory</b>:&#160;8 GB of RAM, OpendTect itself needs at least 2 GB RAM. Therefore, 8 GB will almost certainly be the absolute minimum.</li>
            <li><b>Storage</b>: Hard Disk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recommended</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modern Linux distro</b>. We have tested:<ul><li>RedHat/CentOS 6.0 and higher</li><li>Ubuntu 16.04 and higher</li><li>OpenSUSE Leap 42.1 and higher</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>CPU</b>: Intel/AMD processor with 64 bit support, 3+&#160;GHz multi-core. <br />Note that OpendTect uses all processors if necessary. The more cores and speed, the better. OpendTect will automatically use multiple threads in many situations. This depends on the type of attribute, display, etc. We put a lot of effort to get time-consuming tasks  multi-threaded.</li>
            <li><b>GPU</b>: Nvidia (e.g. recent main-stream up to high-end GeForce series) graphics cards. <br />Quadro or NVS series cards could give the bit extra you want. In doubt, buy the best GeForce card you can find. When buying a laptop make sure that it has a Nvidia chipset.</li>
            <li><b>Memory</b>: on the safe side don't go for less than 32 GB. <br />Buy as much memory that you can afford and fits in the system. The big clients for example use nothing less than 512 GB.</li>
            <li><b>Storage</b>:&#160; SSD is best, other options are Hard Disk or Network Drive. <br />This is usually under-valued, but it's often the crucial performance component. SSD disks will give a tremendous boost in performance; essentially, data on SSD disks loads almost as fast as pre-loaded, in-memory data. Performance could be miserable if data needed to stream through (relatively) slow disks and/or networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>For Machine Learning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Modern Linux distro</b>. We have tested:<ul><li>RedHat/CentOS 6.0 and higher</li><li>Ubuntu 16.04 and higher</li><li>OpenSUSE Leap 42.1 and higher</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>CPU</b>: Intel, 64 bits. <br />Ideally you want the system to be expendable to 4 GPUs. The CPU will need to support all GPUs.  Important to look for is how many PCIe lanes the CPU supports and how many PCIe lanes are needed for the system's number of GPUs and M.2 NVMe SSDs. We recommend to get a CPU with at least 8 cores, 16 threads and 40 PCIe lanes.</li>
            <li><b>GPU</b>: Nvidia, GeForce or Quadro series. <br />The GPU needs to be fast enough and able to fit the model and data batch in memory. When in doubt choose the one with more memory.&#160;Other things to look for is the number of CUDA cores, tensor cores and GB memory bandwidth per second. We recommend the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti with 11 GB memory.</li>
            <li><b>Memory</b>: DDR4 memory, don't go for less than 32 GB. <br />Buy as much memory that you can afford and fits in the system.</li>
            <li><b>Storage</b>:&#160;The best choice is M.2 NVMe SSD that is big enough for the data. <br />The advantage of M.2&#160;NMVe SSD is that it is plugged into the motherboard and is super fast. Other options are SATA SSD, Hard Disk or Network Drive. Performance could be miserable if data needed to stream through (relatively) slow disks and/or networks.<br /></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>For best performance OpenGL&#160;drivers should be up-to-date. For Machine Learning on GPU we use CUDA 10. Please see this <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#major-components__table-cuda-toolkit-driver-versions" target="_blank">table</a> for the minimum compatible driver version for CUDA Toolkit.</i>
            </li>
            <li><i>Low-level GPUs keep showing poor performances through the generations. Shading functionality requires special GPU features, present in the main-stream and high-end GeForce, Quadro and NVS cards. Nevertheless, under Linux, only Nvidia provides drivers capable of running the shading feature. If you can't see any colors on graphic elements, try disabling shading (Utilities &gt;&#160;Settings &gt;&#160;Look and Feel).</i>
            </li>
            <li><i>Linux distros should be LSB compliant. You can check this using the command <code>lsb_release</code>. This is particularly stringent for commercial plugins using the FlexNet system. There is documentation on installing license files for commercial plugins, and there is a page with background information</i>.</li>
            <li><i>Linux 64 bits releases require v6.0.11 (or newer) of the libstdc++ library to be present on the system. OpendTect is known to work under Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and other distributions, as well as earlier versions of the main distributions, too. Fedora usage is not recommended - although it may work it's the only distro that regularly fails to work in combination with OpendTect. This is probably because the graphics vendors do not support it well in terms of drivers.</i>
