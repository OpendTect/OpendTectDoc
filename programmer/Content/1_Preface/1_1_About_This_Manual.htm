        <p>This is the manual for developers wanting to use, change or contribute to the source code of OpendTect. It describes all necessary steps taken to download and compile OpendTect from source on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. There is also a separate section for those who want to develop plugins, as it is not necessary to build OpendTect completely to effectively develop and debug your own plugin.</p>
        <p>This document was written using MadCap Flare. Two versions are published: an html manual for online use and a pdf version for printing.  Both the html and pdf manual can be separately downloaded from the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="https://dgbes.com/support#documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">documentation</MadCap:conditionalText> page of the dGB website.</p>
        <p>While every precaution has been taken in the preparation of this manual, it is possible that last minute changes to the user interface are not reflected in the manual, or are not described accurately.
