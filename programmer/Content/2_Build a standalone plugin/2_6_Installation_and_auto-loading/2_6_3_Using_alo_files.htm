        <h3>2.6.3 Using .alo files<MadCap:concept term="Using .alo files" /></h3>
        <p>Auto Load files are simple text files that tell a program which plugins it is supposed to load from the 'libs' directory. Since OpendTect contains multiple programs, each program has its own set of .alo files '&lt;program name&gt;.*.alo', while the plugins can be shared between multiple programs. OpendTect will scan for any file with this naming convention. So od_main.john.alo is perfectly OK.</p>
        <p>Since there are multiple vendors and/or plugin sets, each vendor can make his own .alo files. od_main, for example, will look at any file named od_main.*.alo. For this example, the default plugins are specified by od_main.base.alo, while dgb's plugins are specified by od_main.dgb.alo. This way, each vendor can make his own .alo files, without interfering with others.</p>
        <p>A .alo file is nothing more then a simple list of plugins, without extensions. For example, this could be in an od_main.base.alo file:</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">Annotations</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">Madagascar</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">uiMadagascar</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">CmdDriver</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">GMT</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;">uiGMT</p>
        <p>Note that for each platform, a specific .alo file must be created. Usually, they will be the same, but some plugins might not be relevant or supported on all platforms.</p>
        <p>The plugins in the .alo files are loaded in the order as specified in the file. The alo files themselves are handled in alphabetical order.</p>
