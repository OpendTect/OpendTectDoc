        <h2>2.4 Debugging your plugin<MadCap:concept term="Debugging your plugin" /></h2>
        <p>Open the plugin solution in Visual Studio, and right-click on the solution item, and open the solution properties window. Here you can specify the debug source file location, so in your case add the location of the OpendTect source files which are installed by the installation manager, i.e. C:\Program Files\OpendTect\<MadCap:variable name="Variables.Version" />. Now select the "od_main" project which is a launcher project to launch od_main debug executable that comes with the developers package. Right click on this project and set to "Set as startup project". When you press F5 for debugging this project will be started. Ignore if you see any Visual studio warnings. The OpendTect main program, od_main.exe will be launched.</p>
        <p>From Utilities-Installation-Plugins OpendTect try to load your plugin by browsing to the WORK(D:\WORK)\bin\win64\Debug folder. To debug something, just set a break point in the code. So when the control comes to the break-point it will stop there and you can debug your code. You can also browse into OpendTect source files if you have specified the OpendTect source file location is the solution properties as mentioned above.</p>
