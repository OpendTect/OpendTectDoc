        <h2>4.2 <MadCap:concept term="Setting up the environment" />Setting up the environment</h2>
        <p>To build OpendTect from source you need to pull the source code from https://github.com/OpendTect/OpendTect. Then build the solution with CMake. In this case launch CMake and browse to your OpendTect source folder and start configuring and generating from CMake. CMake will prompt for Qt and OpenSceneGraph directory location, select them from CMake itself and continue. Once the projects and solution are generated you can start building OpendTect.</p>
        <p>Qt</p>
        <p>A Qt installation is only necessary when you want to build a plugin which is directly dependent on Qt or you want to build OpendTect from scratch. Download Windows Qt package from the Qt website.</p>
        <p>OpenSceneGraph</p>
        <p>A full OpenSceneGraph installation is only necessary when you want to build a plugin which is directly dependent on OpenSceneGraph or if you want to build OpendTect from scratch. Download an OpenSceneGraph installation, or get the source code from OpenSceneGraph repositories and build yourself using Visual Studio.</p>
