        <p>A group of classes that handle a certain area of our domain is what could be called a module. Sometimes these modules have their own namespace, most often not (sometimes because the code pre-dates good support of namespaces by gcc). In any case, it does correspond with two physical directories in the source tree: include/module_name and src/module_name. Thus earth model related classes go in the EarthModel directories.</p>
