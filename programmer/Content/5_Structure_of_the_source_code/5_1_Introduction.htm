        <h2>5.1 Introduction<MadCap:concept term="Introduction" /></h2>
        <p>The repository contains a number of release branches and 3 development branches. The current stable release branch is 6.4.4</p>
        <p>The development branches are:</p>
        <p>BRANCH	DESCRIPTION</p>
        <p>master</p>
        <p>This is the bleeding edge where migration of OpendTect to new versions of its major dependencies, Qt and OpenSceneGraph, is tested and major new functionality is added.</p>
        <p>od6.4</p>
        <p>This is the main development branch for the next stable release series 6.6. No new features are currently being added to this branch as it is being prepared for release.</p>
        <p>od6.5</p>
        <p>This branch is used for developing new incremental features against the 6.4 series codebase for future integration into the software.</p>
        <p>Very short</p>
        <p>OpendTect:</p>
        <p>•	Is in C++ and a tiny bit of C</p>
        <p>•	Uses CMake, which makes it easy to port across platforms</p>
        <p>•	Is built with design principles and strict separations of functionality</p>
        <p>•	Uses exclusively open source tools</p>
        <p>•	Can be extended using plugins</p>
        <p>C++</p>
        <p>OpendTect is a C++-based environement. A couple of years ago, C++ was declared dead by many as a result of the Java hype. In some areas, Java is indeed far better suited. In our part of the world (geosciences, in particular geophysics-related), we don't think Java can match the advantages of C++: Fast yet flexible, Low-level yet supporting high-level OO constructs. And, we would be terrified having to program without templates.</p>
        <p>That doesn't mean that programming in C++ automagically delivers good software, and neither that performance comes easy. Those are some of the things that can be reached by a good design.</p>
