        <p>You can contribute to the enhancement of OpendTect either by:</p>
        <p>•	providing bug fixes or enhancements to the OpendTect source code following the usual Github Fork-Pull Request process.</p>
        <p>•	or independently by developing and releasing open source plugins from your own Github or equivalent repository. See the <a href="https://github.com/waynegm/OpendTect-Plugins" target="_blank">wmplugins repository</a> as an example of this approach.</p>
        <p>An overview of the design principles and preferred coding style/practices employed by dGB in the development of OpendTect are described in <a href="../6_Principles_and_best_practices_in_OpendTect_coding.htm" target="_parent">dGB's coding guide</a>.</p>
