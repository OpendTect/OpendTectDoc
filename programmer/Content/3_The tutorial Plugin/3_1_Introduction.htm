        <p>We have created the Tutorial plugins that you can find in your work environment. As is common in OpendTect, there is a plugin 'Tut' for non-ui, real-work stuff, and the 'uiTut' for the GUI part.</p>
        <p>The idea of the tutorial plugins is to show a variety of common things that one might want to do, rather than make something useful for end-users. For that we'll make the following tools:</p>
        <p>•	Manipulating some seismic data (read, process, write)</p>
        <p>•	The same, but now using an Attribute</p>
        <p>•	Do some work with horizons</p>
        <p>•	Do some work with wells</p>
        <p>In the process, we'll see how to:</p>
        <p>•	Create menu items and toolbar icons</p>
        <p>•	Make right-click tree item menus</p>
        <p>•	Work in the OpenSceneGraph 'vis' world</p>
        <p>•	Work with DataPack's and create flat displays</p>
