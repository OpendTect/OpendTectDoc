        <h2>3.6 The Tutorial Attribute<MadCap:concept term="The Tutorial Attribute" /></h2>
        <p>We have seen the direct seismic approach to simple operations on seismic data in SeisTools. For our purpose, it suits well. But the main problem with this approach is the difficulty in multi-trace handling. Moreover, for large seismic volumes, handling each trace one-by-one may slow down the process. This brings us to another approach called Attributes. In this example, we define the Tutorial attribute to do things once done by SeisTools. As we discuss different aspects of making an attribute, we will also discuss its advantages over the direct seismic approach.</p>
        <p>The main plugin file "tutpi.cc" makes a call to <span style="font-family: monospace;">Tutorial::initClass()</span>. The class Tutorial ( tutorialattrib.h ) is defined as a subclass of <a href="../Generated/html/classAttrib_1_1Provider.html" target="_parent"><span style="font-family: monospace;">Attrib::Provider</span></a> class. Every attribute is a provider, each can thus be used as input for another attribute.</p>
