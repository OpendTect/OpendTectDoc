        <p>Software engineering is a game of trade-offs. Performance vs generality, flexibility vs stability, priorities vs general goals, and so on, and so on. A good software engineer weighs all pros and cons and comes up with (near-)optimal solutions, often trying to get the best of everything. Of course, in fact, sometimes things can be completely ignored (e.g. in dialog-UI's performance is seldomly an issue).</p>
        <p>Goals</p>
        <p>When creating and maintaining software code, invariably one wonders what choice will come out optimally. To define 'optimal', we have to define the goals we want to maximise. The most obvious is:</p>
        <p><b>(1) Total time spent (man-hours)</b>
        </p>
        <p>Less obvious, but also very important is:</p>
        <p><b>(2) Total programming pleasure</b>
        </p>
        <p>The issue is that we software developers have to 'live' in the code, for many hours each day. Nothing is more dissatisfying than to have to go through code that looks like crap, even though the code may be working. Not being able to find what you need, is another issue. Too complex code, too. Finally, maybe an item not really fitting in the list, but still:</p>
        <p><b>(3) Team-readyness</b>
        </p>
        <p>If you find pleasure in typing 15-level '?'-statements - so be it. If your entire team likes it there is no problem either. But chances are you will be crucified by your team members when they have to do anything with your code.</p>
