        <p>Any complex process can be broken up into simple steps, any complex object can be broken up into simple objects. Always consider yourself as publishing something that needs to be read by others. Take them by the hand and make it easy to understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. Avoid repetitions, complex constructions or long lines. Make things compact if that will make things clearer, or uncompact if needed.</p>
        <p>The best code you will ever make will invariably look as if it has cost hardly any time to make. Like good dancers make it look like there is no effort involved, an excellent solution always looks simple, compact and easy to use.</p>
