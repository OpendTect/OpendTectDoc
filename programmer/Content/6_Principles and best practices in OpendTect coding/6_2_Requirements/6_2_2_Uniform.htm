        <h3>6.2.2 Uniform<MadCap:concept term="Uniform" /></h3>
        <p>This is not a point to be taken lightly. Other team members will at some point have to change your code, other team members will at some point have to debug your code. Uniformity makes sure this is as easy as possible. Remember this: changing code you haven't made yourself is never easy, so do everything you can to help your team members. Moreover, changing code you've made some time ago is never easy, so you're even doing it for yourself.</p>
        <p>The implications are simple although a lot of programmers have a lot of problems with it:</p>
        <p>Rule (2): Make your code look just like all the other code.</p>
        <p>Combining (1) and (2) could casually be described as: make sure all team members feel at home in your code at all times.</p>
