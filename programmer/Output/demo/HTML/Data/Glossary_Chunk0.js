Attributes can be calculated from single-trace, multi-trace, and multi-volume inputs. They can be steered and/or chained. \n\nSteered attributes are multi-trace attributes in which the trace segments are found by following a (pre-)calculated dip-azimuth.

It is used for both 2D and 3D pre- or poststack data. A file being SEG-Y compliant does not mean that it can be loaded into OpendTect. There are several possible problems. One of these is missing trace identification and/or positioning. Another issue is lack of true compliance -\u003eSEG-Y Rev 0, -\u003e SEG-Y Rev 1).\n\nThe different types of SEG-Y are shown below:\n\n* SEG-Y Rev 0: The initial SEG-Y specification in 1975. It is very precise in some areas but totally unspecified in other, crucial areas. This has led to an almost uncountable number of variants. Some are sort-of SEG-Y standard, others blatantly non-compliant.\n\n* SEG-Y Rev 1: In 2002 the Revision 1 document made an end to the most obvious shortcomings of -\u003eSEG-Y Rev 0, especially in the area of -\u003etrace positioning and -\u003etrace identification. Still many SEG-Y files or files claimed to be SEG-Y are Rev 0 or badly (i.e. not) compliant with Rev 1. This is why OpendTect has numerous options for the SEG-Y reading process.\n\n* SEG-Y Textual header: The first 3200 bytes of a SEG-Y file must be filled with textual comment on the contents of the SEG-Y file. Older textual headers are encoded in EBCDIC rather than ASCII, which makes them impossible to read in a standard text editor.\n\n* SEG-Y EBCDIC header: -\u003e SEG-Y Textual header.\n\n* SEG-Y Tape Header: The part of a SEG-Y file that gives information about all traces in the file. This information is in the -\u003eSEG-Y Textual header and -\u003eSEG-Y Binary header.\n\n* SEG-Y Binary header: The second part of the SEG-Y Tape header contains binary information about, amongst others, values for number of samples per trace, byte encoding, sample interval, and SEG-Y Revision.\n\n* Trace identification: Every trace in OpendTect needs to have an identification in form of a trace number (2D data) or inline/crossline (3D data). For prestack data the offset forms and extra trace identification.\n\n* Trace positioning: In OpendTect, every seismic trace needs to be located in 3D space. For 3D data, the position can be derived from the-\u003eTrace identification (inline- and crossline numbers). Traces in 2D lines have their own, separate X- and Y- coordinate. For prestack data there must also be an offset available.',l:''},'SSIS':{d:'A plugin to perform a sequence stratigaphic analysis (systems tracts, Wheeler transforms) from seismic data using HorizonCube input.
