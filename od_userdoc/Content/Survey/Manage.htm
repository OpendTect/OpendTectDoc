        <p>OpendTect keeps track of the different files imported into or created by the system. Deleting, renaming, setting as default, merging of files (in some cases) …etc are controlled from the Manage window. Most objects (seismic volumes, horizons, wells…etc) have a dedicated ‘manager’ that can be called from this menu.</p>
        <p>The most frequently used managers can be reached directly from the main user interface:</p>
