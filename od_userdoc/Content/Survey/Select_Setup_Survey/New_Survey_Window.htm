        <h3>4.1.2 New  Survey Window<MadCap:keyword term="New Survey Window" /></h3>
        <p>To launch the survey setup window select <i>New</i> in survey selection window.</p>
        <p>Depending on whether you have OpendTect or OpendTect Pro installed, one of the following windows will appear on your screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Survey/Survey new window 2 and 3D define by free.png" style="width: 490px;height: auto;max-height: auto;" class="General_Image" /> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Survey/Survey new window 2 and 3D define by pro.png" style="width: 490px;height: auto;max-height: auto;" class="General_Image" /></p>
        <p>Almost all setup options are available for both the Free and Pro versions, with the exception of: Scan VDS file and Scan ZGY&#160;file.</p>
        <p><b>Survey name:</b> In the text area specify the OpendTect survey name.</p>
        <p><b>Available data:</b> Toggle on the data type(s) to be included in the survey - any combination of: 3D, 2D and Wells. <u style="font-style: italic;">Note:</u> Select only 3D, if the survey contains only a 3D type data set. Select both 2D and 3D, if the survey is to contain both 2D and 3D type data sets. If the survey contains only 2D type data set, select only 2D.  Selection type here affects the tree structure and what functions and attributes are available to you once the survey is operational.</p>
        <p><b>Initial setup:</b> Determines how you set up the survey ranges and coordinates. Each Initial Setup option will be dealt with in its own sub-topic, links below.</p>
        <p><b>Z Domain:</b> Can be in time or depth (for depth, define here the unit as m or ft)</p>
