        <h3>4.5.7 Manage Geometry 2D<MadCap:keyword term="Manage Geometry 2D" /></h3>
        <p>2D Geometry is launched from <i>Survey &gt; Manage &gt; 2D Geometry...</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>This window is used to manipulate the geometry of 2D seismic lines. The geometry consists of X-Y coordinate pairs for each trace of the 2D seismic, identified with a unique trace number (CDP most often). They are generally extracted from the SEG-Y trace headers or from an auxiliary file during import.</p>
        <p>This window can be used to alter the coordinates of already imported 2D data. The geometry is separated from the actual 2D seismic data and 2D horizon that are solely referenced with respect to the trace number (CDP number). As a result the coordinates of the geometry can safely be edited without having to re-import the 2D seismic data and corresponding horizons.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Manage 2D geometry main.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p> Select a line and click on the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/browse2dgeom.png" class="Icons" />icon to start the line geometry editor.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Line geometry editor</p>
        <p>This editing window can be used to alter any trace number, X, Y values. Click on a field and type the new value. Changes will be saved on disk only after pressing <i>Ok</i>. Optionally one might want to update the geometry of the entire line by reading an text file (see below).</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Manage 2D line geometry.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Line geometry import</p>
        <p><i>Select</i> the input Ascii file. To display the input file, press the <i>Examine</i> button. The input file should be column sorted with one point per record (line).</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Manage 2D read new line geometry.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>The presence of a <i>file header</i> and the file <i>format definition</i> have to be specified. The header, if present, can be of fixed length (number of lines), or delimited on its last line by a keyword.</p>
        <p>Predefined and saved file formats are available by pressing on the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/Open.png" class="Icons" />icon. Otherwise the format must be manually specified. The <i>Define</i> button gives access to the format definition window.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Manage 2D format definition.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>You must specify in the format definition window the column numbers for the position, in terms of an X/Y pair, and optionally the trace number column. The coordinate units must be in the same units as the coordinates of the survey corner points. Inline/crossline value may be used instead of X/Y but it is not recommended because of the grid spacing. Also it is not recommended to alter (re-specify) the trace numbers since it may corrupt the already loaded data. Reading may be stopped at a specific line by providing the adequate keyword.</p>
        <p>It is recommended to save the format definition for a later use and QC, by clicking on the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" />icon . In pop-up window, write the name of the format and store it. The format can be stored at different levels (all surveys, this survey, Current OpendTect user level, levels in increasing priority order) depending on the usage. Press OK when done.</p>
