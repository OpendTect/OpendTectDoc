        <h4>Statistical Wavelet Extraction</h4>
        <p>Statistical wavelets can be extracted from the seismic data.</p>
        <p>The User first needs to choose the input seismic, i.e 3D volume or 2D line.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If 3D seismic is selected, the following window pops up:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It is recommended to use a sub-selection of the seismic data, e.g. every 10th inline/crossline, and to use horizons to guide the extraction. The extract length of the seismic data should be at least 1 second TWT.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The wavelet length should never be too small (min 50ms), or too large (200ms max). A rule of thumb is that the first side lobe should be fully contained in the wavelet.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The extraction is performed using the following workflow:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Seismic traces are extracted and tapered</li>
            <li>The auto-correlation of the seismic traces is computed, using the length of the desired wavelet</li>
            <li>The frequency spectrum of the auto-correlation is computed.</li>
            <li>The square root of the modulus of the frequency spectrum is taken, the zero Hertz component is muted to zero.</li>
            <li>The inverse FFT is computed.</li>
            <li>The zero phase wavelet is the real part of the inverse FFT output</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The output phase rotation cannot be set in the current version. It is being implemented.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Wavelet extraction in 2D line is shown below:</p>
