        <h6>Extract 2D Attributes from 3D Volumes</h6>
        <p>This extraction tool, started from the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/extr3dseisinto2d.png" class="Icons" /> icon, can be used to project a 3D volume onto 2D lines. This allows then to display the 3D volume along the lines, and to use the data from the 3D volume with 2D lines in the 2D attribute set.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Manage seismics extract 2d from 3d.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>All lines may be processed, or a selection of lines made in the lines manager before going to this window. The settings are trivial: the 3D volume must be selected and an attribute name must be provided.</p>
        <p>Please note that the polynomial interpolation does not fit an application of this tool to 3D seismic data.</p>
