        <h1 class="h6">Merge 2D Lines</h1>
        <p>Two 2D lines can be merged together to create a single 2D line. Go to Survey &gt; Manage &gt; Seismics &gt; 2D. In the pop-up window, click on the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/man2d.png" class="Icons" /> icon on the right of the window. In the new window, the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/mergelines.png" class="Icons" /> icon on the right opens the merging window. The merge can be either of 2 lines with about the same geometry, or to append two (consecutive) lines to each other.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are three alternative merging methods:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Match trace numbers: Assumes the lines are at the same location, containing different attributes to be stacked and referenced using the same trace number array.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Match coordinates: Same as above, but with different trace number arrays. Then the match will be based on coordinates, with a search radius to match the traces. Please note that traces will be renumbered in this mode.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Bluntly append. Append the line specified at the "Add" field line after the "First line". Please note that traces will be renumbered in this mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&#160;</p>
