        <p>A number of in-built advanced rock physics formulas can be selected to create various types of logs from available well log data.</p>

        <p>The type of output log quantity is chosen from <i>Property Type</i> list (e.g. Density, Velocity and Pressure). Afterwards, a specific formula out of a number of possible alternatives can be chosen to compute the required log quantity. The choice of equation depends on several factors such as the type of available log quantity and the region (e.g. a rock physics equations might work well in Gulf of Mexico but not in North Sea). After this selection has been made, the formula will be displayed along-with a short description below it.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The standard values for variables of the selected formula is also displayed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">It is extremely important to keep in mind that the input log quantities (e.g. Sonic) MUST be converted in to particular units for the formula to work. These units are already selected by default and should NOT be changed. Same applies on the output unit of measure as well.</p>
