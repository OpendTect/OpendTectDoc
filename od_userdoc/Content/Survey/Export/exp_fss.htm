        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Export FaultSticksets</p>
        <p>The FaultSticksSets are exported by selecting <i>Survey &gt; Export &gt; FaultSticksSets &gt; Ascii.</i>.. sub menu. It will launch export FaultStickSets window. In that window select the input faultstickset and mention the output coordinates format (X/Y or Inline/crossline). By default the option to export Z in msec is checked and it will add a z-column in the output file. In a depth survey, the Z values are exported by default in meter and you need to specify if they are in feet. Optionally the sticks can be stored with a node/stick index or a stick index only. Depending upon other packages requirements, an appropriate selection can be made for adding index information in the file. Locate the output file location with an output name. If you want to add a line name in the output file name, set check to the Write line name if picked on 2D field. Press OK to start exporting the fault sticks.</p>
