        <h4>Export Ascii 3D Horizons</h4>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Export horizons 3D popout.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>In the pop-up window, select the input surface (horizon). The stored surface data are listed in the <i>Calculated attributes</i> list. You can select one/more calculated attributes to be written in the output file. To de-select an attribute, use CTRL-key and left mouse click or click in the empty space. You can make a sub selection of the <i>Available patches</i>. Each patch will be stored in a different file with extensions ^1, ^2, etc.</p>
        <p>Three types of ascii files are supported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>X/Y saves in x/y information.</li>
            <li>Inl/Crl saves inline crossline.</li>
            <li>IESX (3d_ci7m) saves in GeoFrame IESX format. In this case you need to choose if the survey co-ordinate system as it is set up in OpendTect is in <i>feet</i> or in <i>meter</i>. Optionally, the horizon name in the file can be edited by clicking on the <i>Settings</i> button which appears on selection of the IESX format as output type.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the output type selected is either X/Y or Inl/Crl, optionally Z can also be outputted. Z can be in time (If time survey, units: in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds ; if depth survey, units: Meter, Feet, Inches, -Meter or -Feet ) or Z can also be <i>transformed</i> and converted to depth using either a linear relationship (Vo and dV/dt to be specified), a velocity cube or a well (Z outputted in Meter, Feet, Inches, -Meter or -Feet if time survey, in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds if depth survey). Z is written as the last column of the output file. Additionally, a single line or multi line eader can be included in the output file. The standard value of undefined data can also be specified.</p>
        <p>Finally, select the output file location with an appropriate file name. Press <i>Go</i> to start exporting the horizon.</p>
