        <h4>Survey Ranges</h4>
        <p>The survey ranges are the inline, crossline and Z-range values. The ranges define a 3D survey area for 3D seismic surveys and 2D grid area for 2D seismic surveys. These fields can be filled manually, by scanning a SEG-Y file (2D/3D), using <i>set for 2D only</i> option in Ranges/coordinate settings, or by copying the ranges from another survey. If the <i>Workstation Access plugin</i> is available, one will see the <i>Get from GeoFrame</i> or <i>Get from Seisworks</i> option in the drop-down menu.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The set for <i>2D only</i> option is especially used to create a 2D seismic survey. Set the average trace distance and the x and y coordinate ranges, and these will automatically be translated into suitable survey settings.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Click on the <i>Scan SEG-Y file(s)</i> button to select a SEG-Y file. In the new window, you set the SEG-Y settings, see also <a href="../import/imp_seis/segy/segy_imp.htm" target="_self">SEG-Y scan section</a>. Pressing OK will start scanning the file(s). After scanning, you'll get a file report containing sampling info, data statistics, and the survey setup. The <i>Survey ranges</i> and <i>Coordinate settings</i> will be filled in automatically.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The <i>Z range</i> is specified in milliseconds, meter, or feet. The steps are incremental Z-steps of the survey i.e. the seismic sampling rate.</p>
