        <h1 class="h2">Select &amp; Setup Survey</h1>
        <p>The Survey module is used to select, create, modify, delete or copy surveys. A survey defines the geographical boundaries of an OpendTect project and relevant positioning information such as the relationship between inline/crossline and X/Y co-ordinate systems. Each survey (project) stores its data in a separate directory that needs to be specified along with the survey reference name. Moreover, the survey rotation angle is displayed; this angle shows the deviation from geographic North.</p>
