        <p>SEG-Y import preparation starts with the <i>SEG-Y tool</i> window.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b><u>Mandatory</u> workflow in the first step:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your (first) file using the file browser.</li>
            <li>Choose the correct file type:<ul><li><i>3D Volume</i></li><li><i>Pre-Stack Volume</i></li><li><i>2D Line</i></li><li><i>Line 2D Pre-Stack</i></li></ul></li>
            <li>If multiple SEG-Y files representing one 3D volume (pre-stack or post-stack) have to be loaded you must specify the number of files to be merged during loading. The input SEG-Y files must contain blocks or inlines. File names must be indexed like file1.sgy, file2.sgy..., any file can be selected and the index must be replaced in the input field by a wildcard (*):</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In most cases you can press the<i>Next</i> button after you have done the two actions listed above. Only if you have a proiri knowledge that the file might be having some problems you would like to perform one of the following actions before pressing <i>Next</i>.</p>
        <p><b><u>Optional</u> actions in the first step:</b>
        </p>
        <p>1. <a href="../Manipulate_SEG-Y_File.htm">Manipulate SEG-Y file</a>: allows to edit text, binary and trace headers of a SEG-Y file.</p>
        <p>2. <i>Number of traces to examine</i>: A set of traces may be examined at the beginning of the file. Looking at the output is strongly recommended but not mandatory for a successful import. This can be disabled by entering "0". Pressing <i>Save as default</i> will save the number of traces to examine in your user settings.</p>
        <p>3. <i>Overrule SEG-Y number of samples</i>: If the number of samples per trace is not or incorrectly written in the line and/or trace headers you can overrule it here.</p>
        <p>4. <i>SEG-Y format</i>: If the format of the data samples is not or incorrectly written in the line header you can overrule it here.</p>
        <p>5. <i>Bytes swapped</i>: Most header values and/or data samples are written using several bytes for each word/sample. Therefore a correct byte order is a necessity. Thus, if the trace headers don't seem correct or if the sample values are unexpectedly large numbers, byte swapping might be required.</p>
        <p>After pressing <i>Next</i> a pop-up question (<a href="SEG-Y_Revision.htm">SEG-Y revision</a>) and the <a href="../SEG-Y_Examiner.htm"><i>SEG-Y examiner</i></a> window will appear. It is recommended to answer the questions and examine the traces before moving on to the second wizard window.</p>
