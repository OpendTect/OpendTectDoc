        <h4>Bulk</h4>
        <p>The bulk import tool allows for the import of well-data for different wells from one or several files. The data is matched against primarily the well name and, if available, against the Unique Well Identifier (UWI). This has the following implications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The well name must appear on each line of the input file. If the well already exists, then the UWI must match the database. The same applies for the UWI if it is used in combination with the well name.</li>
            <li>The well name should not contain spaces, otherwise the matching with a given column number will not work as expected.</li>
        </ul>
