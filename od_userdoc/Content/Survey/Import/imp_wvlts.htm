        <h3>Import Wavelets</h3>
        <p>Wavelets can be used for synthetic-to-seismic tie, or convolution via the <a href="../../app_a/convolve.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">convolve</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">convolve</MadCap:conditionalText> attribute. Wavelets are also used to store all kinds of frequency-derived operators, like seismic spectral blueing and seismic coloured inversion operators.</p>

        <p>Wavelets can be imported into OpendTect as Ascii files. The import window is launched from the OpendTect main menu (<i>Survey -&gt; Import -&gt; Wavelets -&gt; Ascii</i>). This will launch the <i>Wavelet Import</i> window. Select the input Ascii file. You may display the input file by pressing the <i>Examine</i> button. The input file should be column sorted with one time/depth sample position per record (line).</p>

        <p>The main work is to specify the presence of a file header and the file format definition. The header, if present, can be of fixed length (number of lines), or delimited on its last line by a keyword.</p>
        <p>Predefined and saved file formats are available by pressing the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/open.png" class="Icons" />  icon. Otherwise the format must be manually specified. The Define button gives access to the format definition window.</p>

        <p>You must specify in the format definition window the column number where to read the amplitudes, the sample rate, and the location of the center sample. The sampling interval can be seconds, milliseconds or microseconds. The position of the center sample must be given as the number of lines between the first sample and the center sample. Both values can be dynamically extracted from the header by providing keywords for each, indexed using columns positions. Reading may be stopped at a specific line by providing the adequate keyword.</p>
        <p>It is recommended to save the format definition for a later use and QC, by clicking on the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" /> icon . In pop-up window, write the name of the format and store it. The format can be stored at different levels (All surveys, Current survey, Current OpendTect user level) depending on the usage. Press OK when done.</p>
