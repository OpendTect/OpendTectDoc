        <h5>SEG-Y Examiner</h5>
        <p>SEG-Y examiner window is used to examine the textual, line and first trace headers. It is a useful tool that serves two purposes:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>1- Examination of the headers so that, if necessary, SEG-Y settings can be found and adjusted.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Import segy examiner.png" class="General_Image" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The plot between any individual trace header and the number of random traces examined is a very good tool to visualize its range and inspect for any discrepancy.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>2- Viewing the first traces in a 2D viewer.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Import segy examiner 2d viewer.png" class="General_Image" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It is strongly recommended to always display the traces in the 2D viewer. This is done from the examine window by using the <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/vd.png" class="Icons" /> icon  . The examine window will show the entire textual header, the words in the line header that are different from zero, and the entire trace headers of the first traces. You can use the vertical scroll bar to browse through the file headers and locate the information to import.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Optionally, the save button  <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" />can be used to store the textual header.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Use the lateral scroll bar at the bottom to locate the header words that change with the traces. They indicate traces, crosslines, offsets, coordinates etc. It is unlikely to see the inline number vary in the first traces. However,it is often at the bytes preceding the crossline number. Increasing the number of traces to examine will help finding the inline number.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Please note that the examine window can stay open during import.</p>
