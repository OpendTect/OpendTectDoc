        <h3>Import Color Table</h3>
        <p>Colortables can either be imported from 'Other user' or from 'File'. Default colortables are stored in a file (ColoTabs) that is located in the OpendTect installation directory (/root/OpendTect/5.0.0/data/). The colortables saved by a user are stored in a file (settings_coltabs.user) that is located in the user home directory ($HOME/.od/), here user is the OpendTect username. These files can be modified or imported by using import color table window (see below).</p>
