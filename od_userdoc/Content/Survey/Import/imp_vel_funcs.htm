        <h1 class="h3">Import Velocity Functions</h1>
        <p>Velocity functions can be used to create volumes from irregularly sampled data, using the volume builder (that is the <a href="../../anal/vol_build_setup/vol_build_setup.htm" target="_self">only way after import to display the data</a>). Although designed to create velocity volume, it can be used for any other quantities that velocities: All usual log types (density, sonic, impedance, ...), or quantities with a strong low frequency component. Velocity functions are not appropriate for regularization of band-passed data (seismic, relative impedance, ...).</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Velocity functions can be imported in OpendTect using Ascii files. The import window is launched from the OpendTect main menu (<i>Survey &gt; Import &gt; Velocity functions &gt; Ascii</i>). Select the input Ascii file. You may display the input file by pressing the <i>Examine</i> button. The input file should be column sorted with one point per record (line).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The amplitude <a href="imp_seis/tagged_seis.htm" target="_self">type</a> of the input data must be specified. This will be required for the interpolation of the values. Indeed the vertical interpolation will not be done directly on Vint and Vrms amplitudes, but on the corresponding time-depth function.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the Interval velocity quantity (Vint), the amplitude of a point accounts for the layer above it.</li>
            <li>Effective velocities (Vrms) can only be used in time surveys. They will be treated with a simple Dix for the extraction of the time-depth relation.If this type is selcted, you need to specify if it has statics or not.</li>
            <li>Vavg is the ratio at a given depth between depth and travel-time: Vavg = 2*Z/TWT = Z/OWT. As a result a Vavg quantity holds entirely the data from time-depth pairs.</li>
            <li>Delta, epsilon and eta functions will be vertically interpolated with linear interpolation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Any other quantity type could be tagged as delta, epsilon or eta and gridded using the standard velocity gridding step of the volume builder.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The main work is to specify the presence of a <i>file header</i> and the file <i>format definition</i>. The header, if present, can be of fixed length (number of lines), or delimited on its last line by a keyword.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Predefined and saved file formats are available by pressing the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/open.png" class="Icons" /> icon. Otherwise the format must be manually specified. The Define button gives access to the format definition window.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/5 Menu - Survey/Import velocity functions format definition.png" class="General_Image" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You must specify in the format definition window the column numbers for the position, in terms of an X/Y pair or an inline-crossline pair, the time/depth column, and the amplitude value. If velocities are read, linked anisotropies may also be imported in the same velocity functions object. This is used during velocity analysis only. Amplitudes that should not be read must all have the same numerical value, which is to be filled in as the "Undefined value". The Z units can be seconds, milliseconds or microseconds (meters of feet in depth surveys). Please note that all records must have an X-Y-Z position. Reading may be stopped at a specific line by providing the adequate keyword.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It is recommended to save the format definition for a later use and QC, by clicking on the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" /> icon . In pop-up window, write the name of the format and store it. The format can be stored at different levels (All surveys, Current survey, Current OpendTect user level) depending on the usage. Press OK when done.</p>
