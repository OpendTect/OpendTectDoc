        <h3>4.6.1 Preload Seismics<MadCap:keyword term="Preload Seismics" /></h3>
        <p>The pre-load seismic data functionality is introduced inside the OpendTect to speed-up the working efficiency with large volumes. A common practice is to add an inline/crossline/2D line in the tree and display it in the scene. Each time the line is displayed, the stored volume is read. Therefore, the seismic volumes that are routinely used, can be preloaded. Also if the same seismic data like attribute cube is pre-loaded, the efficiency of displaying the data in the scene is improved.</p>
        <p>Seismic data can be pre-loaded in OpendTect by going to <i>Survey &gt; Pre-load &gt; Seismics...</i></p>
        <p>Clicking on <i>Seismics</i>.., the pre-load manager pops-up to allow the user to <i>Add</i>, i.e select the data to pre-load.</p>

        <p><i>Pre-load seismic data manager</i>
        </p>
        <p>Preload manager is used to load a 3D volume, 2D lines, 3D Prestack volumes or 2D Prestack lines in the memory. Each data can be unloaded separately in selecting it and clicking on <i>Unload Selected</i>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, after selecting a pre-load data, a user can optionally save <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" /> the settings for the later use. These settings can be opened <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/Open.png" class="Icons" /> when needed.</p>

        <p><i>Pre-load 2D 3D data</i>
        </p>
        <p><b>Input Cube:</b> Choose input volume.</p>
        <p><b>Scan:</b> Press Scan to populate a histogram by extracting a defined number of traces from the selected volume.</p>
        <p><b>Format on disk:</b> Format of the selected volume as stored on disk.</p>
        <p><b>Load as:</b> Data can be optionally pre-loaded in another format (e.g. to reduce RAM usage).</p>
        <p><b>Scale values:</b> Choosing of a different format may require scaling the values to ensure nothing is left out.</p>
