        <h3>4.6.1 Preload Seismics<MadCap:keyword term="4.6.1 Preload Seismics" /></h3>
        <p>The pre-load seismic data functionality is introduced inside the OpendTect to speed-up the working efficiency with large volumes. A common practice is to add an inline/crossline/2D line in the tree and display it in the scene. Each time the line is displayed, the stored volume is read. Therefore, the seismic volumes that are routinely used, can be preloaded. Also if the same seismic data like attribute cube is pre-loaded, the efficiency of displaying the data in the scene is improved.</p>
        <p>Seismic data can be pre-loaded in OpendTect by going to <i>Survey &gt; Pre-load &gt; Seismics...</i></p>
        <p>Clicking on <i>Seismics</i>.., the pre-load manager pops-up to allow the user to <i>Add</i>, i.e select the data to pre-load.</p>

        <p><i>Pre-load seismic data manager</i>
        </p>
        <p>Preload manager is used to load a 3D volume, 2D lines, 3D Pre-stack volumes or 2D Pre-stack lines in the memory. Each data can be unloaded separately in selecting it and clicking on <i>Unload Selected</i>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, after selected a pre-load data, the user can optionally save <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/save.png" class="Icons" /> his/her settings for the later use. These settings can then be opened <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/open.png" class="Icons" /> for use later.</p>
