        <h2>1.3 About OpendTect</h2>
        <p><b>OpendTect</b> is a seismic post-processing and interpretation system, as well as an R&amp;D platform, for developing innovative seismic interpretation tools.</p>
        <p>The system is released under a triple licensing strategy:</p>

        <p>This manual describes the functionality in the OpendTect system. Manuals for commercial plugins have their own help files.</p>
        <p>The manual may contain figures with dGB plugins like HorizonCube, SteeringCube, Neural Networks etc ... However, these commercial plugins are described individually in different sections in the dGB-plugin documentation.</p>
        <p><b>OpendTect system features</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualization and analysis of 2D and 3D seismic data in a single survey.</li>
            <li>Sophisticated 2D and 3D horizon tracking including auto-tracking, plane-by-plane, line and manual tracking.</li>
            <li>On-the-fly calculation and visualization of various attributes and filters.</li>
            <li>Multi-platform distributed computing</li>
            <li>Plug-in architecture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Other features in OpendTect</b>
        </p>
        <p>OpendTect is built with MSVC 2005 starting from version 4.0, allowing for better integration with the third party libraries and stability on Windows Operating Systems. New features have now been made available, previously unavailable for versions built with Cygwin. OpendTect is available for both 32 bit and 64 bit Systems for Windows.</p>
        <p><i>Installation and directory structure:</i> The installation and directory structure are entirely different from the previous releases. Unlike the previous versions, OpendTect is a complete Windows application and does not require any Unix shell scripts for its operation. The console window is no longer necessary for OpendTect on Windows. OpendTect can automatically find its current installation folder and load the data, plugins and icons from respective folders. Use of DTECT_WINAPPL environment variable no longer needed.</p>
        <p><i>Progress Windows:</i> The launching of batch programs and view progress windows is now implemented in similar manners to that of Linux, which means the application has almost the same features on both Unix and Windows (Previously, Cygwin Installation could not launch view progress window ).</p>
        <p><i>User Messages:</i> User messages have been standardized, containing relevant text on the buttons rather than only yes/no options.</p>
        <p>Implementation of a new Axis Drawer: An axis drawer has been implemented with better looking arrows and annotations. The new Axes will not interfere with the other 3D objects in the scene. It is now possible to take the snapshot of the scene along with axes, allowing the user to understand the orientation of the survey in the snapshot image.</p>
        <p><i>Implementation of Top Bottom Image:</i> Users can add rectangular Images on top or bottom of the survey box with transparency. This feature is useful if users want to add any reference map of the survey so that they can understand the geographical position and corresponding seismic profile in a better way.</p>
        <p><i>View Orientation:</i> A View North, and View North-Z options are available to the Graphical Tools toolbar along with View Inline and View Crossline buttons.</p>
        <p><b>Wacom digitizing tables</b>
        </p>
        <p>OpendTect is the first seismic interpretation system to support Wacom digitizing tablets. Workflows for horizon tracking, fault interpretation, drawing of polygons &amp; bodies etc... have been adapted to benefit from the superior hand-eye co-ordination offered by the pen device.</p>
