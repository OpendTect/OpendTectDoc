        <h2>1.3 About OpendTect<MadCap:keyword term="1.3 About OpendTect" /></h2>
        <p>The OpendTect suite of software products consists two parts: an open source part and a closed source part.</p>
        <p>The open source part is called OpendTect. This is a seismic interpretation software system for post-processing, visualizing and interpreting multi-volume seismic data, and for fast-track development of innovative interpretation tools.</p>
        <p>The closed source part is called OpendTect Pro. OpendTect Pro offers extra functionality for commercial users. This system can optionally be extended with a set of commercial plug-ins that are for sale and rent. The plug-ins offer unique seismic interpretation work flows for specialist work. </p>
        <p>Commercial users can create their own system by picking and choosing from an extensive list of commercial plug-ins. Bundles of plug-ins have been combined into packages that are made available against discounted prices. The following packages exist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attributes &amp;&#160;Filters</li>
            <li>Sequence Stratigraphy</li>
            <li>Inversion &amp;&#160;Rock Physics</li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">To see what functionality is supported in OpendTect, OpendTect Pro and each of the three packages, please check this <a href="http://www.opendtect.org/index.php/products/supported-technology" target="_blank">table</a> on the OpendTect website.</p>
