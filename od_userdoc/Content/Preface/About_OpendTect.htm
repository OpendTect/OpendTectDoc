        <h2>1.3 About OpendTect (Pro)<MadCap:keyword term="About OpendTect" /></h2>
        <p>The OpendTect Pro suite of software products consists two parts: an open source part and a closed source part.</p>
        <p>The open source part is called OpendTect. This is a seismic interpretation software system for post-processing, visualizing and interpreting multi-volume seismic data, and for fast-track development of innovative interpretation tools.</p>
        <p>The closed source part is called OpendTect Pro. OpendTect Pro offers extra functionality for commercial users. OpendTect Pro has the capacity to be extended with a range of commercial plugins that are for sale and rent. The plugins offer unique seismic interpretation workflows for specialist work. </p>
        <p>Commercial users can create their own system by picking and choosing from an extensive list of commercial plugins. Bundles of plugins have been combined into bundles that are made available against discounted prices. The following bundles exist:</p>
