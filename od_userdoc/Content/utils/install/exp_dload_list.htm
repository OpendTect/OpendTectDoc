        <h6>Export Download List</h6>
        <p>This option allows the user to download the list of URLs of the individual packages from the download site. This list is stored in a text file which can be used later to download these files directly without the help of the installer program. After downloading, user can run his/her own unzipping scripts to install the packages manually. This facility was only developed for the Linux users. Windows users can use this feature, provided they can prepare their own installation scripts for the installation.</p>
