        <h4>Location Filters</h4>
        <p>The filters should be used to further limit the amount of data to be extracted for making cross-plots. Several filters can be used simultaneously.</p>

        <p>Filters are of two types:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first two filters, <i>Random</i> and <i>Subsample</i>, are not position related. The <i>Random</i> filter passes a certain percentage of random samples selected in the main extraction window, while the <i>Subsample</i> filter will pass a finite (user-defined) number of samples. For instance, for the <i>Random</i> option, if the value is 1, only 1% of all extracted data would be selected for cross-plotting.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The last four - <i>Range</i>, <i>Polygon</i>, <i>Table</i> and <i>Surface</i> (see <a href="att_based_extr_win.htm" target="_self">previous section</a> for definitions) are position based filters. These are used to define sub-areas that will complement the extraction settings provided in the main extraction window. Multiple filters can be chosen out of these. Thus, the points satisfying the main extraction settings and all defined filters will be used for the extraction of attributes.</p>
