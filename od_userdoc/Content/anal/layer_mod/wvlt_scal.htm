        <h4>Wavelet Scaling</h4>
        <p>If the wavelet has not been scaled to the real seismic, a pop up window will first appear prior to access to the attribute selection window.</p>

        <p>The user has 3 choices :</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>•	[Start tool] to start the <a href="wvlt.htm" target="_self">Scale wavelet window</a></p>
            <p>•	[Mark scaled] if the wavelet is considered as scaled or does not need to be scaled</p>
            <p>•	[Ignore] if the attributes that are going to be extracted will not need a scaled wavelet</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the wavelet is scaled or marked as scaled, it will be remembered and the window will not appear again.</p>
