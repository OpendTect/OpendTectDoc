        <h3>Basic Modelling - Introduction</h3>
        <p>Each layer in the stratigraphy column is characterized by different rock properties. The model, based on the stratigraphy, is assigning properties to each lithology, layer by layer. The model is built using a blocky approach. The different properties are selected within a list. Their value can either be constant or vary within a given range.</p>
