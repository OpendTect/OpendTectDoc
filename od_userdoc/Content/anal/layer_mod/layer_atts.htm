        <h4>Layer Attributes</h4>
        <p>For each modeled property, data can be extracted either along the log using a defined extraction window or by layers:</p>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>•	Sliding: the property value is extracted within the extraction window where a calculation window slides along the well. The size of the calculation window is defined by the step provided by the user on the first crossplot window. The output is the nearest sample, the average, the median, the RMS or the most frequent. At the end the attribute has <i>[number of pseudo-wells* round up (Extraction window size/Step)]</i> samples.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>•	Integrated: Different lithologies have different properties. In the <a href="layer_desc.htm" target="_popup">Layer Description</a>, the behavior of each lithology has been defined for the modeling. The modeled properties can then be extracted and easily compared with the crossplot tool. Each modeled property can be extracted at the different level of the framework, for one or more lithology of one or more layer. One value corresponds to one model. The output will be the average, the median, the standard deviation, the minimum or the maximum of the extracted data for each model. The number of sample depends on the step and the thickness of the extraction block. The thickness of the block may vary from one pseudo-well to another depending on the model definition. Thus the number of sample can vary from one pseudo-well to another. For one attribute, the number of sample is equal to the sum of the round up (Extraction block thickness/Step) of each pseudo-well.</p>

        <p>In both case, it is possible to transform the attribute value in applying the function power, log or exponential. The attribute is extracted on each pseudo-well.</p>
