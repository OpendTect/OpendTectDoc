        <p>Once the simulation has been run, the pseudo wells will have been generated and these well properties are then displayed in the lower section. The synthetics are also generated and display in the upper half of the window. When clicking on a given pseudo-well, a line appears to show the selected pseudo-well and right-clicking on a particular layer of this selected pseudo-well gives a menu to various options.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For this selected pseudo-well, the <i>Properties</i>... option gives access to the characteristics of this specific layer in term of thickness and modeled properties. In the layer-based modeling (basic or stochastic), these values can be manually modified. The fluid content can also be edited. Changes are saved when clicking <i>Ok</i> and the display is automatically updated.</p>

        <p>In the SynthRock plugin, in the Profile mode, a similar window is available on right-clicking on any trace on the lower rectangle where a selected property is displayed for the different pseudo-wells. In selecting <i>Inspect values</i>, the window opens. In this case it is an informative window: the different property values can not be changed. The fluid content however can be edited. The lithology in this case is unknown as it is based solely on well log(s).</p>
