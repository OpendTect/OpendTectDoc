        <h3>Well Log Tools</h3>
        <p>The well log tools can be used to remove spikes, smooth and clip the logs. it can also accessed by using the<img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/tools.png" class="Icons" /> icon in the <a href="../../survey/manage/man_wlls/man_wlls.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Manage Wells</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Manage Wells</MadCap:conditionalText> window. Multiple wells can be selected at once along-with the various logs. The logs can be extracted between:</p>
        <p><b>Markers:</b> The bounding markers have to be specified. If necessary, the distance above/below these bounding markers (from where the actual extraction of the logs is going to start/stop) can also be specified:</p>

        <p><b>Depth range:</b> The logs can be directly extracted between a particular depth range:</p>

        <p><b>Time range:</b> The logs can be directly extracted between a time window. The extraction may be done in time domain by toggling on 'Extract in time'.</p>
        <p>On pressing <i>Go</i> the extracted logs are displayed and 'smoothing', 'clipping' and 'spike removal' can be performed on these well logs:</p>

        <p><b>Smooothing:</b> A window size (samples) should be defined in which the smoothing of the well log data will be performed.</p>
        <p><b>Clip:</b> Percentage <i>Clip rate</i> has to be defined.</p>
        <p><b>Remove spikes:</b> De-spiking of the logs can be done by specifying a window size (samples) and the <i>Threshold</i> for the Grubbs algorithm. Further, the removed spike values can be replaced by 'Undefined values', 'Interpolated values' or can be manually specified.</p>
        <p>Finally, the edited logs can be saved with an extension or can be overwritten.</p>
