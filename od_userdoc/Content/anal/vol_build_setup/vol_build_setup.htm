        <h2>Volume Builder Setup</h2>
        <p>The volume builder <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/volproc.png" class="Icons" /> setup is used to apply volume-based operations, unlike the attributes that work trace-by-trace. The setup is launched via the <i>Analysis &gt; Volume Builder</i> menu. The setup is a very useful tool for gridding velocities or other rock properties.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis volume builder main window.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>The volume builder setup window contains several available steps that are applied sequentially to generate a volume. Any particular step can be selected from the Available steps by double-clicking on it. The later steps may replace the earlier ones, therefore care must be taken when ordering and setting up the workflow.</p>
        <p>Once your workflow is defined, you will need to save this setup. This can be done by writing the name of your setup.</p>
        <p>The computation and storage of a volume processing setup can be found under OpendTect's   Processing menu: <a href="../../proc/create_seis_output/vol_build_output.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Processing &gt; Create Seismic Output &gt; Volume Builder...</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly"><i>Processing &gt; Create Seismic Output &gt; Volume Builder...</i></MadCap:conditionalText></p>
