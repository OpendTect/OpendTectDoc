        <p>The slice position toolbar is used to move the 3D slices (inline, crossline or timeslice) according to the user-defined steps. The slice position and number of steps are manually entered in the fields. The forward and backward arrows of this toolbar are used to move the selected slice in increasing or decreasing directions. The workflow is very simple. Add an inline in a scene. By default, a blank attribute (inline, crossline or timeslice) is added in the middle of the survey box. Right click on the attribute and add display the seismic data. Select the inline in the tree. Note that the toolbar items will be updated and the arrows will be activated. Update the inline position and the steps in the toolbar. Use the arrows to move the inline position according to the given steps.</p>

        <p class="tip"> While moving the planes, the progress bar appears by default every time when a user moves the plane to display the data. This can be avoided by changing the Personal Settings. Additionally, if the computer memory is sufficient, the seismic volume can be preloaded for displaying it quickly. Use Preload settings to keep a seismic volume in the memory.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="tip"> Keyboard shortcuts can be used to ease the sliding: <i>Utilities &gt; Settings &gt; <a href="../../utils/settings/kybd_shrtcts.htm" target="_self">Keyboard shortcuts</a></i>. The step used will be the one specified in the slice position tool.</p>
