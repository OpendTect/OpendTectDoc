        <p><b>Name</b>
        </p>
        <p>Delta Resample -- Attribute that enables residual alignment of seismic volumes</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>This attribute is used to make shifts inside seismic volumes. By defining an input cube and a delta cube, which represents the shifts that should be applied to the input data, a correctly aligned output volume can be generated. The delta cube can be generated by using the attribute "Match Delta". Note that you must use the Z-unit of the input cube. Also note that you must apply a negative shift to move the cube down and a positive shift to move the cube up. Using the "Delta Resample" attribute is very useful in case of working on, for example, multi-azimuth volumes which frequently show some degree of misalignment. This technique can also be very useful for time-lapse seismic data and NMO-corrected data. Only after aligning, a correct comparison can be made between two different volumes.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The delta cube can be generated by using the <a href="match_delta.htm" target="_self">Match Delta attribute</a>. An advanced option in the attribute engine is that, when the input is periodic and contains phases, it is possible to define a (maximum) period. The box "Input is periodic" should be clicked and the period should be defined in the box. However, a situation like that is very exceptional and, in 99 out of 100 cases, the shift can be applied without using this option.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>One of the side-effects of this residual alignment is that existing horizons are not consistent with the data any more. The horizons should be re-snapped to the aligned seismic data by using the option "Algorithms" when right-clicking a horizon in the tree. The third option "Snap to event" enables the user to make the horizon consistent again. Only after snapping the horizons can the user, for example, calculate horizon-steered attributes or performing waveform segmentation.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Flattening or Unflattening a Cube:</b>
        </p>
        <p>Another useful application for this attribute is to flatten or unflatten a cube. The example given below outlines how you would unflatten a cube that you have flattened (for example, using the <a href="../od_trees_elements/hor/flatten.htm" target="_self">Flattening</a> option under the Horizon Workflows fold-out):</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You would create a cube that would have, as a function of the position only, the Z difference between flattened and unflattened volume. For example, you may have set the TWT of the flattened cube to 1000 ms. Using the Horizon attribute you would read the TWT values of the horizon, let's say 1300ms for a particular trace. The shift is thus defined with a mathematics attribute as:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>shift(ms) = ( FlatTWT(s) - HorTWTAttrib ) * 1000 = ( 1 - 1.3 ) * 1000 = -300</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Applying this shift attribute as 'Delta Cube' for your flattened volume (your 'Input Cube') will undo the flattening (in this case, with a negative value, thus shifting the cube down).</p>
