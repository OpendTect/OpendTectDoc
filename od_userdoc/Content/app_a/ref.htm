        <p>Reference -- Attribute that returns the definitions of the extraction position</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>The X, Y, Z, Inline number, Crossline number, Sample number, Inline index, Crossline index and Z index position of the reference (extraction) point is returned.</p>

        <p><b>Output</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>X: outputs the X-coordinate</li>
            <li>Y: outputs the Y-coordinate</li>
            <li>Z: outputs the depth according to the survey setup (e.g. miliseconds, meters or feet)</li>
            <li>Inline nr: outputs the inline number</li>
            <li>Crossline nr: outputs the crossline number</li>
            <li>Sample nr: outputs the sample number starting from 0 ms or the top of the survey when the survey has a negative start time. The first sample has sample number 1. If the survey has 4 ms sampling and starts at 0 ms, at 400 ms the sample number is 101. If the survey has 4 ms sampling and starts at 2500 ms, the first sample has sample number 626. If the survey has 2 ms sampling and starts at -200, the sample number at 0 ms is 101</li>
            <li>Inline index: outputs the number of inlines from the edge of the survey starting at 1 (e.g. If you have an inline range of 2000 to 3000, the inline index will range from 1 to 1001)</li>
            <li>Crossline index: outputs the number of crosslines from the edge of the survey starting at 1 (e.g. If you have a crossline range of 2000 to 3000, the crossline index will range from 1 to 1001)</li>
            <li>Z index: outputs the sample number from the top of the survey starting at 1. (Note: this attribute is identical to sample number if the survey has a negative starting time or starts at 0.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tip">The Reference attribute replaces the old Reference time attribute. Attribute sets containing the old Reference time attribute will be automatically updated to the Reference attribute, with Z as output, which gives an identical output.</p>
