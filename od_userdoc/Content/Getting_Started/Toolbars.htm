        <h2>2.2 Toolbars<MadCap:keyword term="Toolbars" /></h2>
        <p>Many OpendTect processes can be launched most easily by clicking the corresponding icon. We distinguish two types of icons: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Icons that perform one specific action, e.g. <img src="../Resources/Images/Icons/axis-next.png" class="Icons" title="arrow" /> moves the current display element (inline, crossline, Z-slice) N-steps forward.</li>
            <li>Icons that open a menu with multiple options, e.g. <img src="../Resources/Images/Icons/attributes.png" class="Icons" title="attributes" /> launches either the 2D&#160;attributes -, or the 3D attributes - definition window.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Icons are organized in toolbars.&#160;Some toolbars are always present, others only appear when their action is appropriate. For example the display element toolbar (upper left corner) only appears when a display element in the tree is selected and its content varies with the type of display element.  </p>
        <p class="tip">Please note that if you are missing icons in your version of OpendTect then you are probably running a version without (some of) the commercial plug-ins.</p>
