        <p>The synthetic seismic data (both post-stack and pre-stack), the layer property synthetics in Time (e.g. AI, Density etc.) and the stratigraphic levels/markers, from all modeling modules (i.e. Basic, Profile and Stochastic) can be exported along 2D lines. The stratigraphic levels/markers in the modeled pseudo-wells are essentially exported as 2D horizons. This is achieved by clicking on the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/export.png" class="Icons" /> icon at the top right of the modeling window (see below).</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetic datasets main.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>Export of the synthetics can be done onto an already existing 2D line or a new line created on the fly.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics existing 2d line.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>Selecting an existing 2D line</i>
        </p>
        <p>If the 2D line is created on the fly, the <i>Geometry for line</i> has to be defined as well. It can be done by defining a straight line between two X-Y coordinate pairs.</p>

        <p><i>Creating a straight 2D line between two X-Y coordinate pairs</i>
        </p>
        <p>The 2D line can also be created, on the fly, along an existing polygon.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics polygon.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>Creating a 2D line along a polygon</i>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the 2D line can also be created along an existing random line.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics random line.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>Creating a 2D line along a random line</i>
        </p>
        <p>Now, a selection on post-stack data, 2D horizons and pre-stack data can be made for exporting along the 2D line.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics export selection.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>For post-stack data, user can select synthetic seismic and various layer property synthetics (e.g. Acoustic Impedance, Density etc.).</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics poststack selection.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>Post-stack data selection for export</i>
        </p>
        <p>Similarly for 2D horizons, various levels present in the pseudo-wells can be selected.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics export 2d horizons.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>2D horizon data selection for export</i>
        </p>
        <p>and finally (if any) pre-stack data can be selected.</p>
        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/6 Analysis/Analysis layer modelling export synthetics select prestack.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><i>Pre-stack data selection for export</i>
        </p>
        <p>Optionally, a prefix and/or postfix can be specified for various data items. Pressing <i>Ok</i> will export the selected data items along the 2D line.</p>
