        <h2>3.6 Pointset &amp; Polygon<MadCap:keyword term="Pointset &amp; Polygon" /></h2>
        <p>A <i>pointset</i> is a set of locations. They have multiple uses in OpendTect such as for data extraction in crossplot or neural network workflows.</p>
        <p>The drop down menu gives the option to <b>Add…</b> an existing pointset or to create a <b>New</b> one. The new pointset will either be manually picked in the 3D scene or automatically generated.</p>

        <p>A Polygon is a close line defined as connected picks. It defines an area that can be used to define an area of subselection for example. The drop down menu gives the option to either <b>Add…</b> an existing polygon or to create a <b>New…</b> by manually picking on a loaded surface (either horizon or Z-slice) in the 3D scene.</p>
