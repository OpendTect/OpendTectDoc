        <h4>3.7.7.1 Auto and Manual Horizon Tracking<MadCap:keyword term="Auto and Manual Horizon Tracking" /></h4>
        <p>3D horizon interpretation in OpendTect can be conveniently started from the right-click menu of <i>3D&#160;Horizon</i> &gt; <i>New</i> &gt; <i>Auto and Manual Tracking</i> in the Tree of either 3D&#160;scene or 2D viewer.</p>
        <p class="tip">Basemap (requires OpendTect Pro license) significantly enhances any interpretation workflow. For example, it allows to conveniently operate random lines when QCing results of 3D&#160;auto-tracking.</p>
        <p><b style="font-style: normal;">3D Auto-tracking</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>3D&#160;Auto-tracking is the primary, highly interactive workflow for horizon interpretation in OpendTect. The user starts with a few picked seeds, auto-tracks in volume, interactively QCs,  as needed re-tracks with updated parameters and/or edits, and locks QC-ed interpretation. Then interpretation continues by iteratively repeating the steps. The advantage of this work flow is that the horizon is QC-ed while interpreting and, therefore, saves time on editing. Any remaining holes can be filled at a later stage using one of the gridding algorithms.</p>
        <p>The workflow operates in the 3D scene via <a href="Auto_And_Manual_Horizon_Tracking/Horizon_Tracking_Settings.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Horizon Tracking Settings</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Horizon Tracking Settings</MadCap:conditionalText> window, <i>Ctrl</i> + right-click menu,  and/or keyboard short keys (<i>Shift</i> + <i>?</i> to see all).</p>

The <i>Adjacent Parent</i> method tracks larger areas with the same set of input seeds and tracking parameters, which makes it faster to produce horizons, but the risk of loop-skipping increases. It is recommended only for continuous horizons.</p><p><b style="font-style: normal;">Section Auto-tracking</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p><p>Using Section Auto-tracking mode without 3D Auto-tracking functionality is a traditional interpretation workflow, in which the interpreter picks a horizon on a certain grid (usually regular: for example, every 10th inline and 10th crossline). It can be done both in 3D scene and in 2D viewer. The interpreted horizon is then interpolated using one of the gridding algorithms.</p><p><b style="font-style: italic;">Manual drawing</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p><p>This option is used to manually pick horizons in areas where auto-tracking is not feasible.</p></body>
