This is used to blend multi-attributes with similar spectral outputs. This is an interactive tool especially to color blend the iso-frequency grids (or attributes).</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Color blended display:</p><p><i>RGBA* blending attribute display</i> is used to create a normalized color-blended display that often show features with greater clarity and enhances a detail map view. Traditionally, it is used to blend the iso-frequency responses (Spectral Decomposition), but a user can blend three/four different attributes that define a spectrum that is comparable. For instance, spectral decomposition outputs the amplitude at discrete frequencies. So, it renders the same output (unit=amplitude). Depending upon a geological condition or the objective, FFT short window or CWT (continuous wavelet transform) can be chosen. Results are best displayed on time/horizon slices, volume.</p><img src="../../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Horizon colorblended example.png" class="General_Image" /><p>A color blended map view (image on right) of the spectral decomposition (red-10hz, green-20Hz, blue-40hz). Compare the results with the coherency map (image on left). Note that the yellowish colored fault bounder region is thicker as compared to the surrounding regions. The faults throw (red-color) are also clearly observable. Semblance/similarity together with color blended spectral images can reveal better geological information.</p></body>
