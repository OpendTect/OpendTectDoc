        <p><b>Add:</b> Wells are added and displayed in the scene using Add option.</p>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells add.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><b>Tie Well to Seismic:</b> Access the seismic to well tie module. Generally, three parameters are needed for a successful well-seismic tie: sonic/velocity log, density log and a reference wavelet. The wavelet can be either imported or extracted in OpendTect. Logs can also be created in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../Survey/Manage/Manage_Wells.htm" target="_self">Well Manager</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Well Manager</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p><b>New Well Track:</b> Create new well tracks interactively in the 3D scene. After selecting this option the system will prompt for a well track name. After specifying the well track name, display an element (inline/crossline/2D line) in the scene. Drawing the well track on the selected element is enabled. After drawing the well track, right click on the well track name and select the <i>Save</i> option. Note that drawing a new well track works similarly to editing a existing well track. Well track-nodes can be picked on the active elements displayed in the scene. Also note that a display with a Z-scale (View - Z-scale) other than 1 distorts the appearance of distance in the 3D view.</p>

        <p>After loading new wells, items are added to the right-click menu as follows:</p>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Well loaded wells all.png" class="General_Image" /> <img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Well loaded wells individual.png" class="General_Image" style="vertical-align: top;" /><p style="font-weight: normal;font-style: italic;">Well popup menu (multiple) and menu for individual wells.</p><p style="font-weight: bold; page-break-before: always">Multiple Well Options</p><p>These options are available only when more than one well is loaded in the tree, and can be accessed by right-clicking Well in the tree. The new options available when multiple wells are loaded. Items described in the previous sections above will not be described again here.</p><p><b>Create Attribute Log:</b> creates selected seismic data as a log for multi-wells.</p><img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells create attribute log.png" class="General_Image" /><p><b>Constant Log Size:</b> keeps a well log display width relative to a scene zoom ratio i.e. a log display width increases with the zoom in and vice versa. However, this option can be toggled off by clicking on the sub menu item (Basic Well Pop-up Menus). In the later case, a log display width is adjusted opposite to the zoom i.e. if a scene is zoomed in, a log display width is reduced relative to the scene zoomed in ratio and vice versa.</p><p><b>Show all:</b> allows the user to toggle on all well names (top),well names (bottom), markers, marker names, and logs.</p><p><b>Hide all:</b> allows the user to toggle off all well names (top),well names (bottom), markers, marker names, and logs.</p><p><b>Show all items:</b> allows the user to toggle on all wells currently loaded and visible in the tree.</p><p><b>Hide all items:</b> allows the user to toggle off all wells currently loaded and visible in the tree.</p><p><b>Remove all items:</b> allows the user to remove all wells currently loaded and visible in the tree. This only removes the wells from the scene, it does not delete them from the disk.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">Individual Well Options</p><p>Once a well has been loaded into the scene and is visible in the tree, right-clicking an individual well pops-up a window with the following options: </p><p><b>Create attribute log:</b> allows to create a new log by calculating an attribute along the well track. A new window pops up where the attribute, log name, and the depth range should be provided. The Depth range is defined as start depth, stop depth, and sample distance.</p><p><b>Create log cube:</b> enables to create a volume of a selected log. The log is duplicated on a user-defined number of traces around the well location. More than one log can be selected at once and one volume for each log will be generated. This allows easier comparison between well logs and seismic data.</p><p><b>Properties:</b> sets various display settings of a well track, the logs, and the markers. The properties can be set for each well and can also be updated for all wells displayed in a scene. The later can be done using the button Apply to all wells available in the Well Display Properties window.</p><img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells properties log display.png" class="General_Image" /><div style="page-break-before: always"><img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells properties marker display.png" class="General_Image" /></div><img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells properties track display.png" class="General_Image" /><p style="font-weight: bold;">Log display, Markers display and Track display properties</p><p><b>Well Log Properties:</b> In a scene, the log are displayed using the Left Log and Right Log tabs. The logs are displayed on the left and/or on the right of a well track according to a current view. The log properties include the log selection, log range, fill color and the the thickness of the log line. None refers to no log selection/display. If the logs are already <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../Survey/Import/Import_Wells/From_Ascii_Files/Logs.htm" target="_self">imported</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">imported</MadCap:conditionalText>, the Select log should contain the name of the logs in the drop down list. The data ranges and the color ranges are updated automatically from the selected log. However, both fields are editable. Two types of log displays styles are supported. For a standard log trace display style Well log radio button is selected. For a wiggle display, the Seismic radio box is selected. The well logs can be filled with any selected <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../Getting_Started/Color_Tables.htm" target="_self">color table</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">color table</MadCap:conditionalText>. The color ranges can also be manually set/clipped. However, the seismic style contains different settings. The synthetic seismic traces can be displayed by toggling the Seismic radio box ON. The seismic traces can be repeated by specifying the repetition numbers in the spin box adjacent to the Repeat text. The Overlap field refers to the overlap percentage of the repeated traces. Optionally, dual logs spectra can be displayed together on the same side by displaying one log as a trace and filling the color with another log (Fill with Log).</p><p><b>Well Track Properties:</b> The track properties are modified in this tab. The track line thickness is changed by scrolling the Line Thickness spin box. The well track/name color is updated by pressing the colored button. The well name can be displayed above and below the track. The name size can also be increased or decreased. It may be noted that the name size is adjusted relative to the 3D zoom.</p><p><b>Well Marker Properties:</b> Well marker properties tab include the settings for marker's name size, color, shape (3D), etc. The marker size is adjusted using the spin box (up/down). The limits for the size are set from 1 to 100. The color of all markers of a well track can be changed in to a one unique color. This is supported by the 'use single color' option. If the same color is to be assigned to all available well markers, set check to this field and select the color. Additionally, three different 3D shapes are supported (Cylinder, Sphere, Square). The cylindrical shape is added for orthographic camera displays, which is better for the visualization purposes. The height of a cylinder is supported.</p><p><b>Edit Welltrack:</b> Allows you to add or delete nodes to the well track. Deleting nodes is done by holding <b>CTRL</b> and clicking a node. Adding nodes is done by making "node points" on any of the active elements on your screen. Remember that the Z-scale caused a vertical stretch, distorting the appearance of real distance in the 3D view.</p><p><b>2D Log viewer:</b> This property allows you to display a well log in a 2D scene. The display in log viewer is driven by the 3D scene. To interactively display different logs, go to the well properties and make the desired changes.</p><img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Wells 2D log viewer.png" class="General_Image" /><p><b>Save:</b> Stores a new well or saves the changes that were made to an existing one. Provide a name for a new well, and if a depth to time model is available, select the file. The file should have the same format as when <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../Survey/Import/Import_Wells/From_Ascii_Files/Track.htm" target="_self">importing a welltrack</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">importing a welltrack</MadCap:conditionalText>. Optionally, you can examine the file using the corresponding button. Specify if the model uses TVDSS or MS, also the measurement units.</p><p><b>Lock / Unlock:</b> Locks the selected object. This prevents accidental removing, moving, or displaying data on the object. After clicking unlock all manipulations are possible again.</p><p><b>Remove:</b> Removes the well from the tree (not from disc).</p></body>
