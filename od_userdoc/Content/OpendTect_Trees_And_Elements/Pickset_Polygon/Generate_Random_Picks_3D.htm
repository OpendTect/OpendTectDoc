        <h3>3.6.2 Generate Random Picks (3D)<MadCap:keyword term="Generate Random Picks (3D)" /></h3>
        <p>Randomly generated picks are very useful especially for property prediction or object detection. This type of pickset has been defined in first place for unsupervised neural network training (see dGB Plugin documentation for more details, specifically: <a href="http://doc.opendtect.org/6.0.0/doc/dgb_userdoc/Default.htm#default_attribute_sets/unsupervised_waveform_segmentation.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Unsupervised waveform segmentation (UVQ)</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Unsupervised waveform segmentation (UVQ)</MadCap:conditionalText>).</p>
        <p>To generate a random pickset, click on the tree element Pickset/Polygon and in the drop down menu, select: <i>New Pickset &gt; Generate 3D....</i> The following window pops up.</p>

        <p><i>Generate locations by</i> provides several extraction options (see below).</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/generate_locations_by.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>A user-defined number of random picks are created depending on the specified location type. If selecting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Range: specify the inline, crossline and time range (or depth range if in a depth survey)</li>
            <li>Well: select one or more well(s) and specify a time range (or depth if in a depth survey). Optionally add traces in the inline and/or crossline direction around the well track for the location selection.</li>
            <li>Polygon: select a stored polygon and specify the time range (or depth range if in a depth survey).</li>
            <li>Table: select either an already saved pickset or a Table file. The table file needs to be X-Y-Z with no header.</li>
            <li>Horizon: select a horizon and select if you want the picks to be extracted along the selected horizon or the interval from that selected horizon to a second horizon to be selected.</li>
            <li>Body: select if you want the extraction to be inside or outside the body that you selected. If outside, you need to specify the inline, crossline and z ranges for the extraction. By default the outside box is the full survey box.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Optionally, a rejection filter can also be applied by selecting <i>Remove locations</i> (see window below). It passes each random position according to a selected filter (random, polygon, subsample, table, surface…). It is useful to avoid random picks in unwanted regions e.g. by providing a polygon.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/specify_filters.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>The number of random location to be extracted needs to be specified.</p>
        <p>The pick set creation is finalized by giving it an appropriate name, selecting a color to be used for its display and clicking Ok.</p>
        <p class="note">The name can always be changed later from the PickSet manager. The color can also be modified later on from the right-click menu on the pickset name &gt; Display &gt; Properties.</p>
