        <h2>3.10 FaultStickSet<MadCap:keyword term="FaultStickSet" /></h2>
        <p>A <i>FaultStickSet</i> is a set of sticks for faults interpretation. Sticks are segments that are created by connecting two or more nodes.</p>
        <p>The <i>FaultStickSet</i> tree item allows the user to create a new <i>FaultStickSet</i> or to load an existing one.</p>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/4 OpendTect Trees and Elements/Fault stick set popout menu.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>The new FaultStickSet is inserted by selecting the <i>New</i> option in the tree. The blank fault <i>New sticks 1</i> will be inserted as sub-element of FaultStickSet.</p>
        <p>The user can then interpret the fault sticks on inline/crossline/Zslice and/or on 2D lines as well.</p>

        <p>In order to create and edit a faultstickset, check first that the faultstisckset is active in the tree, then do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click along the fault to create your first fault stick for one specific section .</li>
            <li>The second fault stick in the same section is created by <i>shift + leftclick</i> for the first pick then just <i>leftclick</i> for the next faultpick(s)</li>
            <li>To remove a fault stick node, <i>Ctrl+leftclick</i> on the already picked nodes.</li>
            <li>Once you are done with one section, move to another inline/crossline/timeslice/ or 2D line to create new fault sticks. A simple click will start the fault stick creation.</li>
            <li>If you want to edit one stick while being busy with another, just click on one of it nodes to make it active. While editing, you can click and drag a node to another position.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After interpreting the FaultStickSet, use the option <i>Save</i> to save your set with an appropriate name.</p>
