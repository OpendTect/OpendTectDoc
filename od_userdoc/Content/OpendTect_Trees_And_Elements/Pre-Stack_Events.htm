        <h2>3.13 Pre-Stack Events<MadCap:keyword term="Pre-Stack Events" /></h2>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/OpendTect_Trees_and_Elements/Prestack events popout menu.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>This tree item allows you to display picked or imported prestack events in the 3D scene. Note that this tree item is only display when there are prestack events in the current project. Otherwise it is hidden.</p>
        <p>There are five display modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>None:</b> nothing is displayed.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Zero offset:</b> A point shows the location of each prestack events, and the Z value of the zero offset.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Sticks from sections:</b> points show not only the location but also the moveout curve described by the picked events.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Zero offset on sections:</b> Same as zero offset, but only the events that exists on displayed inlines/crosslines will be shown.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Sticks to gathers:</b> Same of sticks from sections, but only the events that exists on <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="Pre-Stack_3D_Viewer.htm" target="_self">displayed 3D prestack planes</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">displayed 3D prestack planes</MadCap:conditionalText> will be shown.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="page-break-before: always">The displayed points are always linked with a thin line. Regardless of the display mode the points are colour-coded with respect to the following color settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Single:</b> Default mode, one single color for all points of the prestack events.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Quality:</b> The color of the points is related to its quality. This attribute is either imported with the prestack event or set when picked in the Velocity Model Building plugin.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Velocity:</b> The color of the points is related to the corresponding interval velocity. Note that for this to work the input prestack datastore and corresponding migration velocity must be specified in the velocity model building plugin.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Velocity fit:</b> The color of the points is related to the deviation between the picked event and velocity of the best fitting normal/residual moveout curve. Note that for this to work the input prestack datastore and corresponding migration velocity must be specified in the velocity model building plugin.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The color of the points, except in single mode, should be adjusted using the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../Getting_Started/Color_Tables.htm" target="_self">colorbar</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">colorbar</MadCap:conditionalText> like with any attribute by ajusting the colorbar and amplitude ranges.</p>
