        <h3>3.6.4 Polygon<MadCap:keyword term="Polygon" /></h3>
        <p>A polygon is a close line connecting locations.</p>
        <p>A new Polygon can be created by clicking on <i>pointset/Polygon</i> and in the drop-down menu select <i>New Polygon...</i> The following window pops up.</p>

        <p>The polygon creation is finalized by giving it an appropriate name, selecting a color to be used for its display and clicking Ok.</p>
        <p class="note">The name can always be changed later from the pointset/Polygon manager. The color can also be modified later on from the right-click menu on the polygon name &gt; Display &gt; Properties.</p>
        <p>To start interpreting a polygon, it needs to be activated by clicking on the element in the tree. Polygon are picked only on z-slice and horizons. Display a plane in the 3D scene, activate the polgon and start picking. The points will be connected by a line.</p>
        <p>Double-clicking will close the polygon. Save the polygon by right-click on its name in the tree &gt; Save. When the polygon is active in the tree, each click will results in a new pick. To remove a pick, press Ctrl and click on the pick to delete. Move a pick by clicking on it and dragging it.</p>
        <p>In the following picture we can see two examples of polygon pointsets, closed polygon (deltaic facies belt), and non closed polygon (fault pointset).</p>
