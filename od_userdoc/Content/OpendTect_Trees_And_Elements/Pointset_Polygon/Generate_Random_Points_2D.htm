        <h3>3.6.3 Generate Random Points (2D)<MadCap:keyword term="Generate Random Points (2D)" /></h3>
        <p>Random points for the 2D data can also be used for the same purposes and worflows as <a href="Generate_Random_Points_3D.htm" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">random  3D points</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">random  3D picks</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>The 2D pointset creation window (see below) is launched by clicking in the tree on <i>pointset/Polygon</i> and selecting in the drop down menu <i>New pointset&gt; Generate 2D...</i></p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Random (2D) pointset creation window</p>
        <p>The number of points to be in this given set needs to be specified. As this extraction is done in 2D, the 2D line(s) where the locations will be extracted need to be selected. The location can be restricted with the Geometry selection (see below). It depends upon the purpose/objective. For instance, if the objective is to detect facies by using random vectors (points) on a surface, then horizon geometry shall be provided.</p>

        <p>If selecting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Z Range: specify the inline, crossline and time range (or depth range if in a depth survey)</li>
            <li>On Horizon: select a horizon alomg which the positions will be picked.</li>
            <li>Between Horizons:  select two horizons in between which the points will be extracted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pointset creation is finalized by giving it an appropriate name, selecting a color to be used for its display and clicking Ok.</p>
        <p class="note">The name can always be changed later from the pointset manager. The color can also be modified later on from the right-click menu on the pointset name &gt; Display &gt; Properties.</p>
