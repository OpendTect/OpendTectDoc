        <h4>4.3.10.2 SEG-Y Scanned</h4>
        <p>Data duplication is a large problem when working with large datasets. All other import tool generate new OpendTect files from ascii or binary files. This new type of <i>SEGY import</i> works differently since it will not create any file but will link an existing SEG-Y file to an OpendTect entry, selectable as any other OpendTect data.</p>
        <p>This special <i>import tool</i> is only available for both stacked and pre-stack data. However, it should be noted that for pre-stack data the performances for reading and processing may be lower than with OpendTect pre-stack datastores that are optimized by importing the usual way. The importation itself is 100% similar to the normal <a href="4.3.10.1 SEG-Y/4.3.10.1.4 SEG-Y Import.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">SEG-Y import</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">SEG-Y import</MadCap:conditionalText>. The only difference is that there will not be any loading after completing the wizard.</p>
        <p class="tip">Please note that since this tool links to an existing file, moving or renaming the file outside OpendTect will break the link and make the dataset unavailable.</p>
