        <p><b>Derive 3D horizon:</b> Create a 3D-horizon from a 2D horizon. As soon as a 2D horizon is tracked, a 3D horizon can be derived by right-clicking the 2D horizon in the tree and choose <i>Derive 3D horizon</i>. A window pops up in which you can select the algorithm (inverse distance interpolation or triangulation), shown in images below. The results can be displayed immediately by selecting the <i>Display after generation</i> option.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Create Flattened Scene:</b> The 2D line(s) can also be flattened using this option. Once clicked, it will create a new flattened scene based on the selected 2D Horizon. (see also: <a href="../../scenes/flat_hor_scene.htm" target="_popup">Flattened Horizon Scenes</a>)</p>
