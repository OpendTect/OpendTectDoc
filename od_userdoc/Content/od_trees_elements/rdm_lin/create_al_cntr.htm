        <h3>Create Along Contour</h3>
        <p>Random lines can be create along the contour geometry. For this, an interpreted horizon grid will be required. The horizon grid is use to generate the random lines at a selected index contours range. All contour values that are present within the given Z-range, are used to construct the random lines. When the process is completed, you can edit the random lines also. This functionality is important to see the seismic section along the contours (e.g. AVO responses, DHIs or hydrocarbon contacts).</p>

        <p>First, specify the <i>input horizon</i>, and optionally select if it is <i>within a polygon</i>. Then define the <i>contour Z range</i> and the <i>step</i>. Then the <i>Random line Z range</i>, there is an option to chose whether the random line Z range will be made <i>relative to the horizon</i> or not. Last step is to give a name to the newly created <i>Random Line Set</i>. If you want to display the random line on creation, check the box <i>Display Random Line on creation</i>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The option <i>Display Random Line on creation</i> can be selected and the new random line will be displayed after clicking OK.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The following picture shows an example of result for a random line created along contour, it is composed of a set of random lines that satisfy the contour z range and therefore is composed of more than one element.</p>
