        <h1 class="h3">Create from Existing</h1>
        <p>This option allows the user to generate random line offset from an existing random line. There is an option available to generate a random line at some distance away from existing random geometry and store it in new random line geometry.</p>

        <p>Create Random line from existing line geometry in left/right or both directions. The direction is defined by the path described by the nodes, in the order seen in the <a href="create_fm_tabs.htm" target="_self">table</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first generation parameter is the <i>input random line</i>, which has to be chosen between the already existing random lines. Then, define the <i>distance from input</i> in meters and the direction in which the node will be added. There are three directions: left, right, and both. The final step is to name the output random line.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Click on the <i>Display Random line on creation</i> box to immediately visualize the random line.</p>
