        <h1> OpendTect Trees and Elements</h1>
        <p>Each scene has a corresponding detachable tree to control the elements to be displayed. A tree consists of several elements of different type, which are described in detail below. Tree elements containing elements one level down can be expanded by clicking on the markers (+ or -) left of each main element. The order in which items appear in the tree can be changed by selecting the item that you want to move, then press and hold <b>shift</b>, and press the arrow up or down keys on your keyboard.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The tree is a utility window that can be moved outside of the main OpendTect window. To do so, first click once on the small squares at the top-right corner of the tree scene, then drag by clicking (left-click) on its title bar to place it anywhere. </p>

            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>A common issue with certain Linux distributions is this: decoupling the tree  causes tree to disappear when using, for example, the attribute engine or when the progress bar is showing. To resolve this, please do the following:</p>
