        <h3>3.6.1 Manual &amp; Empty Picksets</h3>
        <p>An empty pickset is added so that the locations (of object) are picked manually. The empty picksets are generally used for supervised neural network training (see the dGB plugins help documentation). An empty pickset is defined by right-clicking on the <i>Pickset</i> element and selecting <i>New &gt; Empty</i> from the pop-up sub-menu. In the Pickset Creation window, write an appropriate name and press OK to insert an empty pickset in the tree. For instance, lets define an object by using manual picks that are representative of salt. Display the corresponding data (line/slice/horizon) in the scene. To start picking, please make it active by clicking on it (If active, it will be highlighted). Within the scene, start clicking on the displayed data (line/horizon). Each click will add a pick. If the pick is wrong, it can be removed by using <b>Ctrl</b> key and left mouse-button click.</p>
