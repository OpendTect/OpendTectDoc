        <h3>Pop-Up Menus</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Pickset/Polygon Element Pop-up Menu</p>
        <p>This is the menu that pops-up when a user right-clicks on the main Pickset/Polygon element when at least one pickset/polygon is already loaded. It contains the following menu items.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/4 OpendTect Trees and Elements/Pickset popup menus menu.png" class="General_Image" />
        <ul>
            <li><b>Load Pickset...</b> Display stored pickset(s).</li>
            <li><b>Load Polygon...</b> Display stored polygon(s).</li>
            <li><b>New Pickset</b> Adds a new pickset</li>
            <li><b>New Polygon</b> Adds a new polygon</li>
            <li><b>Save changes.</b> The pickset/polygon changes can be saved and reloaded at any time during the building process.</li>
            <li><b>Display only at sections.</b> Display picks on the displayed elements in the graphics area only. This mode enables picking in a new location without being distracted by previously picked points throughout the survey volume.</li>
            <li><b>Show all picks.</b> (Re)display all picks.</li>
            <li><b>Merge Sets.</b> When at least one pickset is opened in the tree, it is possible to merge picksets by right-clicking "pickset". A window pops up and the sets can be selected. A name for the output set should be defined. Picksets can also be merged from the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../../Survey/Manage/man_pkst_plygn.htm" target="_self">Pickset Manager</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Pickset Manager</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <li><b>Show all items.</b> Show the picksets from the tree-scene.</li>
            <li><b>Hide all items.</b> Hide the picksets from the tree-scene.</li>
            <li><b>Remove all items.</b> Remove the picksets from the tree-scene.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Pickset Sub-elements Pop-up Menu</p>
        <p>If more than one pickset is loaded, the following options will be available in the tree:</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/4 OpendTect Trees and Elements/Pickset popup menus sub-elements menu.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Calculate Volume</p>
        <p>In OpendTect, an estimated volume can be computed from a polygon to a given surface.</p>
        <p>The velocity default is set to 3000 m/s. Negative thicknesses can either be discarded or taken into account.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Close polygon.</b> During, and at the end of a picking session, picksets should be stored.</li>
            <li><b>Properties:</b> In this window the <i>Type, Size</i> and <i>Color</i> of the pick markers on the graphics area can be set. The type <i>Arrow</i> is also automatically used when the pick is given directional information in the Set directions option under the pickset pop-up menu.</li>
            <li><b>Display only at sections:</b> Shows picks on the displayed elements in the graphics area only. This mode allows to pick new locations without being distracted by previously picked points throughout the survey volume.</li>
            <li><b>Convert to body:</b> Convert the polygon into a <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../body.htm" target="_self">body</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">body</MadCap:conditionalText>.</li>
            <li><b>Set direction:</b> Display direction, guided by the SteeringCube/attribute. This helps to understand the geological dips and fluid flow. It is assigned by setting a direction to each pick based on dip and azimuth information (attributes). In the pop-up window (see below), specify either a SteeringCube or two attributes providing the polar dip and azimuth in degrees. A velocity of 2000 m/s will be used in time survey to convert the dip from degrees to µs/m if the dip angle data is read from a stored cube instead of the dip angle attribute. Do not forget after setting the directions to save you pickset and change the display type to "Arrow".</li>
        </ul>

It is used to create a body using the polygon as a constraining area. It requires a top and bottom horizon between which the body would be created. This feature is only enabled if SSIS plugin is loaded (or licensed). For details, please go to the Manual SSIS chapter of the plugin documentation.</li><li><b>Lock / Unlock:</b> Lock the selected object. Prevents accidental removing, moving or displaying data on the object. Clicking "Unlock" enables editing again.</li><li><b>Remove:</b> Remove pickset from tree. </li></ul><p class="tip"><b>Note:</b> removing any unsaved pickset will result in complete loss of data.</p><p><b>Export to Google KML:</b> Export selected polygon to a Google KML file. When selected, the following export window is launched. Fill in the output KML parameters and write/select the output file location. Press the 'Ok' button to export the polygon in the selected location. The feature will prompt an additional conversion dialog if the conversion settings for the survey are not defined.
