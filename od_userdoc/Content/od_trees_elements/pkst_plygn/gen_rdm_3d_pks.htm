        <p>Random picks are very important especially for prediction purposes or object detection. These are defined specifically for unsupervised neural network training (see dGB Plugin documentation for more details, specifically: Unsupervised waveform segmentation (UVQ)). The window is launched from the tree element <i>Pickset/Polygon &gt; (right click) &gt; New Pickset &gt; Generate 3D....</i> The following window pops up.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In this window write an appropriate name for the picks and select a distinct color. The generate location by contains several options: Range, Polygon, Table, Surface. It generates random picks within a selected range of inlines/crosslines/time, polygon, table, at a surface, or between two surfaces. Select and fill rest fields that are according to the selection in the <i>generate locations by...</i> option.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Optionally, a rejection filter can also be applied by selecting <i>Remove locations</i>. It passes each random position according to a selected filter (random, polygon, subsample, table, surface). It is useful to avoid random picks in unwanted regions e.g. by providing a polygon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Provide the maximum number of locations to be inserted in the bottom text field. Fill an appropriate random number. Press OK to insert random picks.</p>
