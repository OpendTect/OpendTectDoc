        <h3>Generate Random Picks (2D)</h3>
        <p>Random picks for the 2D data can also be used for the same purposes as that for <a href="gen_rdm_3d_pks.htm" target="_popup">random picks for 3D</a> (read previous section). The pickset creation window for 2D random picks can be launched from the tree element <i>Pickset/Polygon &gt; (right click) &gt; New Pickset&gt; Generate 2D...</i> sub menu. It will launch the following pickset creation window.</p>

        <p>In this window fill/select the fields for name, a color, the number of (random) picks to be generated, on a specific data set (or line(s) in a data set), geometry and Z-range. It may be noted that the specified random picks are generated according to the given geometry. The geometry is defined by a Z-range/ horizon(s). It depends upon the purpose/objective. For instance, if the objective is to detect facies by using random vectors (picks) on a surface, then horizon geometry shall be provided. Similarly, random picks can also be defined between two horizons on the selected lines.</p>
