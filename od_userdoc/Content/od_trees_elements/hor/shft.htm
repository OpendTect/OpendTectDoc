        <h3>Shift</h3>
        <p><b>Shift:</b> The scrollbar allows the user to scroll the 3D horizon vertically. The shift range allows the user to define the upper and lower boundaries of the scrollbar range. The step size defines the distance between each possible horizon position. (e.g. A range of -100 to +100 with a step of 10 allows for the user to scroll through 20 possible horizon positions, centered about the original position.) Different attributes can be calculated for the horizon in this user defined shift range. The user can then use the scrollbar to move up and down and view the attribute as it would appear on that horizon at the various shift positions. This shifted horizon can be saved as surface data to be viewed later.</p>
