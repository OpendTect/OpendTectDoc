        <h3>3.7.6 Flattening</h3>
        <p><b>Write Flattened Cube:</b> It creates the flattened seismic at specified time value of horizon. The output is stored as a new flattened cube. The user can choose the benefit of this option by flattening the cube at the horizon.</p>

        <p><b>Create flattened scene:</b> This option enables the user to create a second scene in which the data is displayed relative to the flattened horizon. This can be a very useful tool in specific situations. By flattening a horizon, the user gets an idea of the approximate section at the time of the deposition of this horizon. The tectonic history can be derived from the difference between the original section and the "restored" section. Another advantage of flattening the horizon is that it becomes easier to evaluate the depositional environments.</p>

        <p><b>Unflattening the cube:</b> Should you need to unflatten the cube then please refer to the following: <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../../app_a/del_resamp.htm" target="_blank">Delta Resample Attribute</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Delta Resample Attribute</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
