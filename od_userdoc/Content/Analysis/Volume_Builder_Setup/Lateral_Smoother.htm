        <h3>5.2.2 Lateral Smoother<MadCap:keyword term="Lateral Smoother" /></h3>
        <p>The lateral smoothing is a rectangular two-dimension smoothing filtering method of the volume.</p>
        <p>The average filtering will be done in the frequency domain by applying a 2D FFT to the Z slices. This requires a rectangular dataset, while the input can be irregular. The filtering type can be chosen between "Median" or "Average" which can optionally be "Weighted". Positions without data or with undefined values are first replaced by the option "Mirror edges" and "Undefined substitution". The "Undefined substitution" can be done by taking <i>Average</i> values between the defined points, <i>Fixed value</i> (one value needs to be specified which will be used everywhere) or using <i>Interpolate</i> between the defined points.</p>
        <p>Finally, this step can be saved by giving a name.</p>
