        <h3>5.2.4 Horizon-based Painter - Advanced<MadCap:keyword term="Horizon-Based Painter - Advanced" /></h3>
        <p>The horizon-based painter is used to create a model between two surfaces. The initial top and bottom values are necessary to be filled in the input. The intermediate values are interpolated to a survey or a horizon. In this window, horizons have to be selected as top/base values. The slope type is used in interpolation to define a slope.</p>

        <p>The horizon-based painter  paints velocities in a 3D area whose geometry is defined by one or more 3D horizons.</p>
        <p>The painted velocities are referenced to a specific time. This time can be either constant (user-defined), or retrieved from a 3D horizon and not necessarily from one of the horizons defining the limit of the body. For example, an intermediary horizon could be used.</p>
        <p>Then velocities are painted from that reference time. The velocity must be provided as a velocity/gradient pair. The values are once again either user-defined or extracted from a surface data (grid) attached to a 3D horizon.</p>
        <p>There is also a much simplified Horizon-based painter also available:</p>
