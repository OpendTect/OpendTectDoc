        <h2>5.5 Layer Modeling<MadCap:keyword term="Layer Modeling" /></h2>
        <p>Pseudo-wells are stratigraphic columns with attached well logs, but without geographical location. Any pseudo-well can be seen as a possible realization of a newly drilled well in the area. The pseudo-wells generation is achieved following a model that has to be defined. To achieve <i>Layer Modeling</i>, preliminary an extended well data analysis has to be carried out. The stratigraphy must be <a href="../Survey/Manage/Manage_Stratigraphy.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">defined</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">defined</MadCap:conditionalText> and then the well logs behavior have to be known in order to be used in the modeling.During the modeling process, the stratigraphy description is fixed and cannot be edited.</p>
        <p>The Layer Modeling is accessible from the <i>Analysis</i> menu but also from the <a href="../Survey/Manage/Manage_Stratigraphy.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Manage Stratigraphy</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Manage Stratigraphy</MadCap:conditionalText> window.</p>

        <p>Basic modeling can be achieved in OpendTect. More advanced modeling are available in SynthRock plugin.</p>
        <p>The Layer modeling workflow is divided into three main steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Model definition: using the stratigraphy description, properties are assigned to the different lithologies within each units. These properties are fixed or can vary. The model definition is used to generate the pseudo-wells.</li>
            <li>Synthetic and Log generation: the pseudo-wells are generated and their associated properties can be displayed. With a wavelet extracted from the real seismic, zero-offset synthetics are generated. Using a ray tracer synthetics can be computed for different offsets and restricted angle stacks can be created. Thus their behavior with varying offset can be analyzed.</li>
            <li>Pseudo-well data analysis: the properties from modeled logs and synthetic seismic can be compared and analyzed layer by layer, lithology by lithology.</li>
        </ol>
