        <h3>3.4.2 Create from Existing</h3>
        <p>This option allows the user to generate random line offset from an existing random line. There is an option available to generate a random line at some distance away from existing random geometry and store it in new random line geometry.</p>

        <p>Create Random line from existing line geometry in left/right or both directions. The direction is defined by the path described by the nodes, in the order seen in the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="3.4.6 Create From Table.htm" target="_self">table</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">table</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>The first generation parameter is the <i>input random line</i>, which has to be chosen between the already existing random lines. Then, define the <i>distance from input</i> in meters and the direction in which the node will be added. There are three directions: left, right, and both. The final step is to name the output random line.</p>
        <p>Click on the <i>Display Random line on creation</i> box to immediately visualize the random line.</p>
