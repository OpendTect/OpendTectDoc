        <p><b>Snapping:</b>  This option allows for the selected 2D horizon to be 'snapped' to the nearest event defined in the Event option (see below).</p>

        <p><b>Interpolate:</b> This is a 2D gridding option for horizon interpolation by filling the gaps/holes in interpretation. If this option is selected for a horizon, it will pop-up the following <i>Horizon Gridding</i> dialog box.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/4 OpendTect Trees and Elements/2D horizon interpolate.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p><b>Keep holes larger than:</b> By checking this box, the gridding interpolation area can be defined i.e. by defining a threshold e.g. 2500m. By setting this value, the gridding is restricted and gaps/holes up to a radius of 2500 meters will be filled.</p>
        <p><b>Algorithm:</b> Interpolation algorithms for 2D horizon(s). Currently, OpendTect supports linear and polynomial types of interpolation.</p>
        <p><b>Output horizon:</b> Overwrite or create a new horizon from the selected horizon .</p>
