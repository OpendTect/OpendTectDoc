        <h3>Bayesian Classification</h3>
        <p>Bayesian classifications are used to link several attributes based on one or several <a href="../../survey/manage/man_pdf.htm" target="_self">Probability Density Functions</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>First, one or several PDF(s) need to be provided. <i>More</i> will allow to select more PDFs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/7 Processing/Processing bayesian classification main.png" class="General_Image" />
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After clicking on <i>Next &gt;&gt;</i>, the PDF(s) can then optionally be normalized based on a priori weights per PDF. The a priori weights can be provided by attribute volumes which will vary at every sample location.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The processing will be based on (inverted) stored volumes that should correspond to the variables used for generating the PDF. Please note that OpendTect cannot make this check.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>If only one PDF was used as input, the Bayesian classification volume will generate two volumes:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>1.	A probability volume "P:PDF name"</p>
        <p>2.	A determination strength volume, mainly for QC.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If more than one PDF were used as input, the Bayesian classification volume will generate:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>1.	A probability volume "P:PDF1 name"</p>
        <p>2.	A probability volume "P:PDF2 name" (one for each input PDF)</p>
        <p>3.	Two classification volumes : Class (with the most likely class) and Confidence (the difference between the two most likely)</p>
        <p>4.	A determination strength volume, mainly for QC.</p>
