        <h4>Advanced Angle Mute Paramaters</h4>
        <p>The ray-tracing can be performed in two ways:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>•	<b>Simple:</b> The ray is going directly from the source to the depth of the target layer, and up to the receiver in the same way. This does not account for ray bending, or velocity inversions.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>•	<b>Advanced:</b> Will honour the ray bending according to Snell's law and thus velocity inversions as well. To reduce the processing time, the layers may be blocked: Consecutive layers with similar Vp, (and density, Vs if present) values are concatenated together. The ray is propagated in a straight line inside a concatenated layer.</p>
