        <h3>Attribute</h3>
        <p>Some attributes consume significant calculation time e.g. curvature, spectral decomposition etc. It also depends on the size of the input seismic volume. Therefore, to create on-the-fly a horizon data in a scene may take significant time. Following <i>Processing &gt; Create Horizon output &gt; Attribute (2D or 3D)</i>, the attribute calculation is there processed in the background (batch processing) and thus other tasks can be done at the same time. By using a Horizon output, horizon attributes can be created at desired horizons independently.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/7 Processing/Create horizon output attribute.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>Select the quantity to output (2D/3D) from the list of stored data or attributes. The attribute is (by default) saved with its own name, but it can be edited. Select the horizon on which the selected attribute will be calculated.</p>
        <p>The parameter file, which is automatically created in the Store Processing Specification field, can have any name (a default name is provided) so that the calculation process can be easily re-started if needed. The batch processing can be achieved using a single or multiple machines. More information on this window is provided in single machine batch processing section. After the batch processing is finished, the result will be available as a horizon data: right-click on a blank horizon's attribute in the tree to select the horizon data (Select Attribute &gt; Horizon Data).</p>
        <p>If the option for 'Fill undefined parts' is toggled on, then the '<i>Settings</i>' button can be used to enter the interpolation settings:</p>
