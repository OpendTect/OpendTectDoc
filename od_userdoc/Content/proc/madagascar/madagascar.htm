        <h2>Madagascar</h2>
        <p>A generic user interface exists to <a href="http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Madagascar</a>, an open source seismic processing package that is very popular in seismic R&amp;D communities. In the builder, seismic pre- and post-stack input and output files are either OpendTect or Madagascar formatted. The processing flow is constructed as a sequence of Madagascar programs, using their parameters. These programs are selected from a list of available programs (presently over 300), with a search field included to guide the user.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Madagascar processing results can be further analysed in OpendTect.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">1- First Madagascar must be installed in order to use this interface between OpendTect and Madagascar.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">2- It's not possible to view Madagascar plots directly from the OpendTect user interface on Windows. If the user wants to see the plot, she/he has to make her/his own arrangements like starting the xserver etc ...</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="caution"> Problems may occur occasionally when using Madagascar on a <b>Windows</b> system.</p>
