        <h2>1.1 About this Manual<MadCap:keyword term="1.1 About This Manual" /></h2>
        <p>This manual combines primer, reference guide, and theory into one document. New users are advised to read the Getting Started section, which acts as a primer to the system. Detailed information on windows and parameter settings are described. Advanced users may also look at some of the Appendices. Appendix A describes attributes and filters, what they do, and what parameters can be set.</p>
        <p>This document was written using the online Documentation Tool system. Two versions are published: an html manual for online use and a pdf version for printing. The html manual comes with the OpendTect software when it is downloaded from the Download Center. Both the html and pdf manual can be separately downloaded from the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="http://opendtect.org/index.php/support/documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">documentation</MadCap:conditionalText> page of the OpendTect website.</p>
        <p>While every precaution has been taken in the preparation of this manual, it is possible that last minute changes to the user interface are not reflected in the manual, or are not described accurately. Please help us improve future editions by reporting any errors, inaccuracies, bugs, misleading or confusing statements you encounter.</p>
        <p>Please note that apart from this user manual, there is also an Application manager manual. These can be found in the doc/SysAdm/base directory or the software installation directory. Commercial plugins are not described in this manual but in separate Help files.</p>
