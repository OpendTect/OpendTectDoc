        <h2>6.5 Madagascar<MadCap:keyword term="Madagascar" /></h2>
        <p>A generic user interface exists to <a href="http://www.ahay.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Madagascar</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Madagascar</MadCap:conditionalText>, an open source seismic processing package that is very popular in seismic R&amp;D communities. In the builder, seismic pre- and poststack input and output files are either OpendTect or Madagascar formatted. The processing flow is constructed as a sequence of Madagascar programs, using their parameters. These programs are selected from a list of available programs (presently over 300), with a search field included to guide the user.</p>
        <p>Madagascar processing results can be further analysed in OpendTect.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First Madagascar must be installed in order to use this interface between OpendTect and Madagascar.</li>
            <li>It's not possible to view Madagascar plots directly from the OpendTect user interface on Windows. If the user wants to see the plot, she/he has to make her/his own arrangements like starting the xserver etc ...</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="tip"> Problems may occur occasionally when using Madagascar on a <b>Windows</b> system.</p>
