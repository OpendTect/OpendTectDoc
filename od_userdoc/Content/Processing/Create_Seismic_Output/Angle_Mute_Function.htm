        <h3>6.1.3 Angle Mute Function<MadCap:keyword term="6.1.3 Angle Mute Function" /></h3>
        <p>This module creates angle-based Z-Offset functions from velocity volumes. The primary input is a velocity model that provides the time-depth relation.</p>

        <p>If you have no velocity volume available, click '<i>Create</i>'. This will bring up a window in which you can select a volume and tag it with a velocity type:</p>

        <p>Vertical 1D ray-tracing is performed assuming a fully flat, isotropic earth model. The travel-time 0ms corresponds to the depth of the Seismic Reference Datum, defined in the <a href="../../Survey/Select_Setup_Survey/Edit_Survey_Window.htm" target="_blank" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">survey definition window</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">survey definition window</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <p>The offset range must be provided since the angle mute computer is not aware of any prestack datastore. It does not necessarily need to match the prestack data. The output function will have one point at the start and stop of the Z range, and one point at each offset specified by the offset range parameters.</p>
        <p>The main output parameter is the incidence angle in degrees at which the mute function must be computed. By default the functions will be computed on a relaxed grid, every 20th time the inline/crossline stepout. This can be changed by selecting other "Volume subselection" parameters. In general it is not necessary to decrease that stepout.</p>
