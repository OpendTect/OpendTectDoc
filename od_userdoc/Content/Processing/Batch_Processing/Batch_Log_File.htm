        <h3><a name="top"></a>6.6.3 Batch Log File<MadCap:keyword term="Batch Log File" /></h3>
        <p>A batch log file is produced for every volume output run. The information is streamed to a file if the batch job is executed on a remote computer. If the processing is done locally the log file is either streamed to a new, dedicated window, or to the standard output window. Every N traces the program will output a symbol to reflect the progress. There are five symbols the program can use. Which symbol it uses depends on the speed in number of traces times N per sec (given towards the end of a line in brackets after the percentage of traces processed) and the estimated remaining time until completion. The symbols indicate the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a period (<b>.</b>) means 1 trace processed</li>
            <li>a colon (<b>:</b>) means 10 traces processed</li>
            <li>an equal sign (<b>=</b>) means 100 traces processed</li>
            <li>a pipe marker (<b>|</b>) means 1000 traces processed</li>
            <li>an asterisk (<b>*</b>) means 10000 traces processed</li>
        </ul>
