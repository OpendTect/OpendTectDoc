        <h3>9.2.4 Command Driver<MadCap:keyword term="Command Driver" /></h3>
        <p>The <i>Command Driver</i> offers automated control of the current OpendTect application from a command script. The command script is a replacement for a series of keyboard and mouse interactions performed by the user. It can be used to automate parts of the work flow, and helps to speed up executing repetitive tasks or giving automated demonstrations in OpendTect.</p>

        <p>The Command Driver was created as a tool to make automated testing of the OpendTect releases possible. That means it is not optimized for usage as a scripting tool. It is clear, however, that power users have been starting to use the Command Driver tool for this purpose.</p>
        <p>The list of available commands, their syntax, and semantics can be found in the <a href="../../Appendix_B-Command_Driver_Manual.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">Command Driver Manual</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Command Driver Manual</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
