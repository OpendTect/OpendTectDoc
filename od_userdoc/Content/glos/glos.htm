        <p><b>Accomodation Space</b>
        </p>
        <p>The available space for sediments to fill (measured from seafloor to base-level).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Aggradation</b>
        </p>
        <p>Depositional trend characterized by sediments building upwards.</p>

        <p><b MadCap:targetName="attribute"><a name="Attribute"></a>Attribute</b>
        </p>
        <p>An attribute is a derived quantity from a seismic input set. Attributes in OpendTect are defined by a name, a value, and a position in 3D space (inline, cross-line and Z (2WT or depth)). Attributes can be calculated from single-trace, multi-trace, and multi-volume inputs. They can be steered and/or chained.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Steered attributes are multi-trace attributes in which the trace segments are found by following a (pre-)calculated dip-azimuth. Chained attributes are attributes derived from other attributes. For example, Similarity and Energy are separate attributes that can be chained to calculate the Similarity of the Energy using the "Position" attribute.</p>

        <p><b MadCap:targetName="attributeset"><a name="Attribute_Set"></a>Attribute Set</b>
        </p>
        <p>An attribute set is an entity consisting of a group of attributes. Usually attributes in a defined attribute set have something in common. For example, all attributes in a set have the potential to highlight an object type of interest, or a combined attribute, using all other attributes as intermediate results. This would be a desirable output.</p>

        <p><b>Base level</b>
        </p>
        <p>The surface at which sediment supply, relative sea level changes and wave energy are in balance. This is the surface at which the accommodation space equals zero: there is neither deposition, nor erosion.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Body</b>
        </p>
        <p>A body is an element that defines an arbitrary three dimensional geological shape (or a geo-body). The body can also be created manually or by using polygons.</p>

        <p><b>Meta Attribute</b>
        </p>
        <p>A meta-attribute is an attribute created from multiple input attributes. In OpendTect, a meta attribute is created either through neural networks, or through mathematical manipulations and/or logical operations. For example, TheChimneyCube and TheFaultCube are meta-attributes.

        <p><b>MLP Neural Network</b>
        </p>
        <p>Multi-Layer-Perceptron type of neural network. The network is used for seismic object detection (creating Chimney Cubes, Fault Cubes, Salt Cubes etc.) and for predicting rock properties from seismic data (Porosity, Vshale, Sw etc). An MLP network is trained on a data set with known examples (supervised learning). In the training phase the network aims to find the optimal, non-linear mapping between input attributes and target attributes. The network in OpendTect is a fully-connected, three-layer MLP (input layer, hidden layer, output layer). The non-linear transformation takes place in the hidden layer.

        </p>
        <p>A file format for exchanging seismic or seismic-like data. It is used for both 2D and 3D pre- or post-stack data. A file being SEG-Y compliant does not mean that it can be loaded into OpendTect. There are several possible problems. One of these is missing trace identification and/or positioning. Another issue is lack of true compliance -&gt;SEG-Y Rev 0, -&gt; SEG-Y Rev 1).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The different types of <a href="../4 Survey/4.3 Import/4.3.10 Import Seismic/4.3.10.1 SEG-Y.htm" target="_self">SEG-Y</a> are shown below:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>SEG-Y Rev 0: The initial SEG-Y specification in 1975. It is very precise in some areas but totally unspecified in other, crucial areas. This has led to an almost uncountable number of variants. Some are sort-of SEG-Y standard, others blatantly non-compliant.</li>
            </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>SEG-Y Rev 1: In 2002 the Revision 1 document made an end to the most obvious shortcomings of -&gt;SEG-Y Rev 0, especially in the area of -&gt;trace positioning and -&gt;trace identification. Still many SEG-Y files or files claimed to be SEG-Y are Rev 0 or badly (i.e. not) compliant with Rev 1. This is why OpendTect has numerous options for the SEG-Y reading process.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>SEG-Y Textual header: The first 3200 bytes of a SEG-Y file must be filled with textual comment on the contents of the SEG-Y file. Older textual headers are encoded in EBCDIC rather than ASCII, which makes them impossible to read in a standard text editor.</li>

        <p>Unsupervised Vector Quantizer type of neural network. This network is used for clustering (segmenting) data into a user-defined number of clusters. Cluster centers are found in a training run on a subset of the data. In the application phase the network generates two outputs: 1) the index number of the winning cluster and 2) the match, a value between 0 and 1 indicating how close the input vector is to the vector representing the winning cluster. UVQ segmentation can be performed in 2D mode (waveform segmentation along mapped horizons) and in 3D mode (generates 3D bodies). A display of the cluster centers is a useful diagnostic in waveform segmentation (Neural Network module: Info button).
