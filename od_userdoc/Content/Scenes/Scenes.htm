        <h1>7 Scenes</h1>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/8 Scenes/Scenes popout main.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>The OpendTect main window can have multiple scenes, most of them opened using this menu. The scenes behave like sub-windows within the main window: Each scene has its own tree and can be minimized, maximized, reduced or enlarged in size, without ever going out of the main window. The trees of different scenes can be move on top of each other and sorted as tabs, or completely separated from the main window (they are utility windows).</p>
        <p>The <i>Cascade</i> option will restore a default size for each scene and sort them starting on the upper left corner of the main window.</p>
        <p>The <i>Tile</i> option is a shortcut to maximize each scene by sharing the space of the main window equally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto:</b> The scenes are sorted automatically along the best fitting grid.</li>
            <li><b>Horizontal:</b> The scenes are arranged along a single line.</li>
            <li><b>Vertical:</b> The scenes are arranged along a single column.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If all scenes are maximized the active scene will be annotated on the left in the <i>Scenes</i> menu. Clicking on another scene will make that one active.</p>
