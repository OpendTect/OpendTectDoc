        <p><b>Name</b>

        <p>Reference shift -- Attribute that moves the extraction position in 3D space</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>The <i>Input attribute</i> is extracted at the shifted position. The original reference (extraction) point has inline/crossline co-ordinates (0,0). Relative number 1 means the next inline or crossline, respectively. In case of input of a 2D attribute, the inline/crossline shift is replaced by a single trace shift. The vertical shift is specified in milliseconds using the <i>Time</i> option. There is also the option to use Steering while calculating the Reference shift.</p>

        <p>The Input attribute is extracted at the shifted position. The original reference (extraction) point has inline/crossline co-ordinates (0,0) and Time 0.</p>
        <p>The attribute will take the value from the shifted position and display it at the original reference point. Say that an original position (inl:0,crl:0,Time:0) has a shift of (25,25,100) applied to it, then this will take the output value at (25,25,100) and display it at (0,0,0). (In case of input of a 2D attribute, the inline/crossline shift is replaced by a single trace/time shift - ie: 25,100.)</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that the vertical element of the shift is 'positive upwards' and 'negative downwards'.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Think of a time-shift of +100:<ul><li>Original TWT = 500</li><li>Shifted TWT = (500 + 100) = 600</li><li>The value from TWT = 600 will be displayed at TWT = 500, giving the impression of a upward shift.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Think of a time-shift of -100:<ul><li>Original TWT = 500</li><li>Shifted TWT = (500 - 100) = 400</li><li>The value from TWT = 400 will be displayed at TWT = 500, giving the impression of a downward shift.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Think of an horizontal shift of (Inl:5,Crl:8):<ul><li>Original position = 100,150</li><li>Shifted position = 105, 158</li><li>The value from 105,158 will be displayed at 100,150.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Shifting the reference position is a form of directivity that is useful in multi-attribute analysis. Examples of use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> calculating reflectivity in an Acoustic Impedance volume. Values extracted at +4 and -4 ms would be as input to a Mathematics attribute to perform the actual calculation.</li>
            <li> highlighting flat spots - one may consider attributes that are extracted in a horizontally aligned window.</li>
            <li>measuring differences across a fault plane and comparison of such values.</li>
        </ul>
