        <p>Fingerprint -- Attribute that computes the similarity between a user-defined vector of attributes and the equivalent vector taken at each position in a cube.</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>This attribute computes the similarity between a user-defined vector of attribute values and the equivalent vector taken at each sample position inside the cube. The reference vector can be constructed from one or more positions. A statistical property (average, median, variance, minimum or maximum) is calculated after the construction of the vector. Also, it is possible to construct the vector manually by editing the attribute values of the fingerprint vector. The similarity between the fingerprint vector and the equivalent vector at the evaluation point is computed as the normalized Euclidean distance between the two vectors and ranges between 0 (vectors are not identical at all) and 1 (vectors are 100% identical).</p>

        <p>In order to compare vectors, you can use the "Advanced" option to obtain the ranges for the input values. The ranges are automatically calculated using random picks when you press the button "Calculate parameters". You can also use a pickset to find the ranges or even manually introduce them. In the "Advanced options" window, a weight can be assigned to each individual attribute. The default value of the weight is set to 1.</p>
