        <h3>Setup 2D &amp; 3D Survey</h3>
        <p>To setup a new Survey (2D/3D) press <i>New</i> button <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/addnew.png" class="Icons" /> in the survey selection window. The <i>Create New Survey</i> window will pop up (see below) which will lead you through the setup process.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The survey setup defines the survey box. The key parameters are the survey type and its respective coordinates. These can be entered either manually, by scanning a SEG-Y file, or copied from another OpendTect survey if one already exists in the data root folder. Optionally, in case you have workstation access, you can get them from GeoFrame as well. Or if the OpendTect survey already exists, copy the coordinates by pointing the other survey.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For full details of this setup process, please refer to <a href="../../survey/sel_setup_surv/new_surv_win.htm" target="_self">New Survey Window</a> (and subsequent entries).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"> In OpendTect, everything is tied to a 3D (X,Y,Z) with inline/crossline coordinate system. This is regardless of whether you have 3D data at all. Thus, for a survey which contains only 2D lines, a 'fake' 3D survey box of inline/crossline system is needed. If you want to use both 3D and 2D data, set up the survey according to the 3D cube.</p>
