        <h3>Survey Ranges</h3>
        <p>In the second panel of survey setup window the fields for Inline, Crossline and Z-ranges are filled with following possible ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Filling the ranges by scanning a SEG-Y file:</b> Set the Survey ranges in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../../Survey/Import/imp_seis/segy/segy_scan.htm" target="_self">Scan SEG-Y File(s)</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">Scan SEG-Y File(s)</MadCap:conditionalText>. The <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="../../Survey/Import/imp_seis/segy/segy_imp.htm" target="_self">SEG-Y import window</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">SEG-Y import window</MadCap:conditionalText> will pop up. In this window, select the input file/volume and press OK to start scanning the input file. After the scan is completed, the survey ranges will be filled automatically.</li>
            <li><b>Entering Manually:</b> If you already know the extents of survey ranges (Inline/Crossline/Z-range), just fill the maximum and minimum ranges and corresponding steps.</li>
            <li><b>For 2D only:</b> Set the Survey ranges into Set for 2D only and press GO... The window will pop up (as shown below) in which the average trace distance (which determines the grid spacing of the 3D horizons) and the ranges for XY-coordinates are entered; Fill the approximate values and press OK afterward. These parameters are the survey characteristics used to define the survey box. In the survey ranges the fake ranges for inline, crossline are automatically set. Then fill in the Z range (no precision needed; 2D lines can stick out of the display box in all directions). The limit of the survey box will not affect the loading of 2D lines. The lines outside the survey area would be loaded normally. And that should be it. Press OK and select the new survey.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Get from GeoFrame:</b> This option is used if you have workstation access to get the survey ranges from a GeoFrame project.</li>
            <li><b>Copy from other Survey:</b> Additionally, if the survey already exists, you can copy the ranges from that OpendTect survey.</li>
