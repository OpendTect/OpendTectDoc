        <h4>Coordinate Settings</h4>
        <p>The relationship between inline/crossline and X/Y is setup generally by using this panel. The coordinates are automatically setup after scanning the SEG-Y file. You will only fill them if you are inserting survey ranges manually. Nevertheless, the three point (easy) method is not accurate because of rounding off errors which may not be 100% accurate. Both methods have been described here.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In <b>Easy mode</b>, the coordinates are transformed by using three known points. Under Coordinate settings panel of Survey setup window, fill the inline and crossline and corresponding known XY-transformation as shown in figure of previous section.</li>
            <li>In <b>Advanced mode</b>, the XY coordinates are calculated by using an equation shown below. The inputs required from user are origin (X,Y) and inline/crossline intervals along X/Y directions respectively. By checking the <i>Overrule easy settings</i>, the current easy settings would be overwritten.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The basic idea behind this has been elaborated in following figure:</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>** The required inputs include origin X,Y pair, inline and crossline interval in both X &amp; Y directions.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"> If the provided coordinates are in feet, the Coordinates are in feet check box must be checked. If the survey is a time survey and the Z-range units are set to milli-seconds (ms), you might want to display the depth in feet in the scene/annotations. For the later purpose the check box Display depths in feet should be checked.</p>
