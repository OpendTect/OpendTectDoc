        <h4>Survey Name and Type</h4>
        <p>The top most panel of the survey setup window defines two important things along with its disk location. The <i>Survey directory</i> name is entered in the first field. A directory with this name would be created in the root where you will save the OpendTect survey. The field for <i>Full Survey name</i> is filled with proper name of the survey that will be seen later on in the OpendTect survey selection window. Any name can be given to the survey and its directory but we advise you to gives similar names. The name can be edited later. In third field select the location on disk where you want to save this survey.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The most important thing is the <i>Survey type</i> which can be <i>Only 3D, Both 2D and 3D </i>or<i> Only 2D</i>. The type is set accordingly:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only 3D is used when the survey contains only 3D cube(s).</li>
            <li>Both 2D and 3D is set when survey contains both 3D cube(s) and 2D line(s).</li>
            <li>Only 2D is set when survey contains only 2D line(s). Remember: A fake inline/crossline system is defined to setup such a survey regardless of the fact that the 3D cube is not actually present.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
