        <h3>2D Horizons</h3>
        <p>For a 2D horizon tracking, the workflow is slightly different. The tracking wizard is similar to the 3D tracking wizard shown in the previous section. To start tracking a 2D horizon, click on 2D Horizon element of the tree and select New option from the sub-menu. This will launch the tracking Setup window. The tracking setup contains the tabs similar to that of a 3D horizon. See description of the tracking setup in the chapter: <a href="3d_hors.htm" target="_self">Interpret 3D horizon</a>.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="2D_tracking_setup"></a>First, define the tracking mode. Go to the <i>Event </i> tab to define the tracking parameters (time gate, event, thresholds etc). In this tab, the data on which to track the horizon must be selected.</p>
        <h3>

        </h3>
        <p class="note"> The same horizon can be picked across several 2D lines, providing the horizon is interpreted on lines showing the same 'Input data' (see <i>Event</i> tab)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After defining the event parameters, pick a seed on a displayed 2D line in a scene. If the corresponding settings for event are not appropriate, edit and change the parameters (e.g. time gate and threshold type) and press <i>Retrack</i> icon in the tracking toolbar. This will re-track the same horizon with new settings. After adjusting the appropriate settings for the horizon, the tracking parameter window can be closed by pressing <i>Dismiss</i> button. When closing this window, the tracking settings are saved.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"> In order to change the settings (for tracking), the tracking parameter window can be launched later on by right clicking on a horizon (in the tree) selecting Tracking &gt; Change setup (click on the tracking setup icon <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/tools.png" class="Icons" />). Also at the bottom of the window, the <a href="../../get_started/tbars/trck_tbar.htm" target="_self">tracking toolbar</a> appears. This is routinely used to update the modes and for switching between seeds (TAB-key).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For seed picking the options are:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>* left mouse-click on plane = pick seed &amp; local track</p>
            <p>+ Ctrl-Shift = drop seed</p>
            <p>* left mouse-click on seed = local retrack</p>
            <p>+ Ctrl = remove seed &amp; local retrack</p>
            <p>+ Shift = remove seed &amp; local erase</p>
            <p>+ Ctrl-Shift = undrop seed</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>After finishing the horizon tracking on one 2D line, start tracking on next 2D line. The horizon can be displayed only at corresponding lines by right clicking on the horizon name in the tree, and selecting "Display only at sections". There are also several others options in the pop-up tree.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="tip"> Always save the horizon routinely.</p>
