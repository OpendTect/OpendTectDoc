        <h2>Display Loaded Data</h2>
        <p>To display the loaded Seismic data, use a mouse click on <a href="../od_trees_elements/inl_crl_zslice.htm" target="_self">inline/crossline</a> in the tree and select the <i>Add</i> sub menu from the pop-up tree. A seismic line will be displayed in the middle of a survey that will contain a blank attribute. Right click on the attribute to select and display the loaded data. In a similar way, a 2D seismic line can also be loaded from the 2D Seismic element.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In order to load a horizon, click on the <a href="../od_trees_elements/hor/hor.htm" target="_self">Horizon</a> element in the tree to select the interpreted/imported horizons from a list. Select <i>Add</i> option from the pop-up menu tree. In the pop-up window, select one or more horizons to be displayed in the scene. The horizon with its Z-values will be displayed in the scene. You can edit/select the desired color-spectrum (<a href="../get_started/col_tabs.htm" target="_self">Color Tables</a>). And, just as for inline/crossline/z-slice, you can also add a defined <a href="../app_a/app_a.htm" target="_self">attribute</a> from the active <a href="../anal/atts/att_set_win.htm" target="_self">attribute set</a> that will be calculated on the fly along this horizon.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To display the loaded Wells in the scene, click on the tree element '<i><a href="../od_trees_elements/wlls.htm" target="_self">Well</a></i>' and click '<i>Add</i>'...Select the desired Wells. The Wells would be displayed in the scene. To manipulate a Well and set its properties, right click on the Well name in the tree. The pop-up list will show the options available. From here you can edit Well track, Show/Hide Markers/Logs, change the properties, select logs, etc.</p>

        <p><b>Troubleshooting:</b>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Often, users do not find a good trace number in the SEG-Y headers. Without that, weird things can happen. Use the <i>Examine</i> button in the SEG-Y setup dialog to figure out what header value may be usable as trace number. Or better: find the number that you recognize the data by.</li>
            <li>If X and Y in the SEG-Y file are not correct, the data may be a long way outside the Survey box. Then, nothing may be there after loading a line, or even the entire Survey box disappears.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with your graphics card, the lines may remain white after loading the Seismic data. But if your mouse goes over the line, you can see Coordinates, trace numbers and amplitudes. Then try to:<ul><li>install the latest driver</li><li>make sure you have a good card (hopefully NVIDIA-based)</li><li><a href="../utils/settings/look_feel.htm" target="_self">disable OpenGL shading</a> in <i>Utilities &gt;Settings &gt;Look and feel... Visualization tab...</i></li></ul></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If this does not help, please check through the <a href="../app_c/app_c.htm" target="_self">Appendix-C (SEG-Y Check list)</a></p>
