        <h3>6.1.5 Create from Well Logs</h3>
        <p>The <i>Create seismic output from wells</i> option writes loaded logs as seismic volumes.</p>
        <p>The dialog is accessed from the <i>Processing</i> menu in the main toolbar; choose the <i>Create from Wells</i>.. option.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/7 Processing/Processing create from wells.png" class="General_Image" />
        <p>Select the well(s) in the left and the log(s) in the right list, note that several wells and logs can be selected at once.</p>
        <p>The log extraction can be done either between <i>markers</i> or by selecting a <i>depth range</i>. For the latter, select start/stop depths in meters. For extraction between markers select the wanted markers and add <i>distance above/below</i> (optional) for including intervals above and/or below the marker depths.</p>
        <p>The logs need to be resampled in order to display correctly on seismic sections and volumes. Choose a resampling method from the dropdown list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take Nearest Sample</li>
            <li>Use Average</li>
            <li>Use Median</li>
            <li>Use RMS</li>
            <li>Use Most Frequent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, choose how many traces should be duplicated around the well track. Essentially this will determine the dimension and geometry of the output cube. Finally give a name (suffix) to the CBVS volume (seismic volume), the volume itself will automatically be named according to logs selected in the list.</p>
