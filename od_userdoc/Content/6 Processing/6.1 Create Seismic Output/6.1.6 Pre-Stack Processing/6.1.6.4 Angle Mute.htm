        <h4>6.1.6.4 Angle Mute</h4>
        <p>This processing method computes and applies a mute function. See the <a href="../6.1.3 Angle Mute Function.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">processing method documentation</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">processing method documentation</MadCap:conditionalText>. The only difference is that this method reads the offset range from the input prestack datastore, such that there is need to specify it. See <a href="../../../4 Survey/4.3 Import/4.3.10 Import Seismic/4.3.10.6 Tagged Seismic Data.htm" target="_self" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly">here</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.PrintOnly">here</MadCap:conditionalText> where and when the input velocity source needs to be edited.</p>
        <p>The application of the computed mute function is strictly identical to the application of a stored mute function.</p>

        <p>The ray-tracing can be performed in two ways:</p>
        <p><b>Simple:</b> The ray is going directly from the source to the depth of the target layer, and up to the receiver in the same way. This does not account for ray bending, or velocity inversions.</p>

        <p><b>Advanced (not in the GPL version):</b> Will honour the ray bending according to Snell's law and thus velocity inversions as well. To reduce the processing time, the layers may be blocked: Consecutive layers with similar Vp, (and density, Vs if present) values are concatenated together. The ray is propagated in a straight line inside a concatenated layer.</p>
