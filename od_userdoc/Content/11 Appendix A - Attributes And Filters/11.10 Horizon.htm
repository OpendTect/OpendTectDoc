        <p>Horizon -- Attribute that enables advanced calculations on horizons</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>This attribute is designed to extend the use of horizon data and can be used for several purposes. When applying it to a horizon only, it will give similar results as calculating attributes on the horizon.</p>
        <p>However, when using the output of this attribute as input to a mathematical expression, the output can vary from just a simple thickness calculation to a highly advanced combination of several attributes. You can think of this attribute as different to the other attributes in OpendTect in the sense that it takes horizon data and converts it into seismic data which can be applied as input in volumes.</p>

        <p><i>As shown above, there are two possible outputs, namely Z (depth) and horizon data. For each position on the horizon, the value (Z or horizon data) is used as output along the complete trace.</i>
