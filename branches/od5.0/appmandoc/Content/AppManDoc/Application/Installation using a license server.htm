        <h5>Installation using a license server</h5>
        <p>Again: your primary source of information is <a href="http://opendtect.org/lic/doc/flexnet_explained.html" target="_blank">http://opendtect.org/lic/doc/flexnet_explained.html</a></p>

        <p>If you want to share a common site license amongst multiple users and/or hosts, you can install the Flexlm license manager as a Windows service -- the equivalent of Unix daemons. However, this does not work for demo licenses. These have to be installed on the local host.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">One not so obvious thing is that in the 'Config services' tab, the 'Service name' combobox is editable.</p>
        <p class="note">If OD complains, it might be that the console window contains some info about what is wrong.</p>
