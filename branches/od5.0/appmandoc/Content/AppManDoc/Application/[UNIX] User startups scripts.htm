        <h3>[UNIX] User <MadCap:keyword term="startups scripts" />startups scripts</h3>
        <p>The main script the user will need to run is 'start_dtect' in the installation root. Some power-users will also want to run the 'exec_prog' script (to start specific command-line or batch utilities). Essentially, start_dtect takes no arguments but arguments given will be passed to the od_main executable, which is a standard (X-)Windows and Qt application. The exec_prog script will always have a first argument, which is the program to be executed. The rest of the arguments will be passed to the program.</p>
