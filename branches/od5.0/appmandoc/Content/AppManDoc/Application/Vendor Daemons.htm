        <p>In FLEX lm , licenses are handled by running processes. There is one process for each vendor who has a FLEX lm -licensed product on the network. This process is called the vendor daemon . The vendor daemon keeps track of how many licenses are checked out, and who has them. If the vendor daemon terminates for any reason, all users lose their licenses.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Client programs communicate with the vendor daemon through TCP/IP or UDP/IP sockets. The client (where the application runs) and the daemon processes (the license server) can run on separate nodes on your network. Also, the traffic between the client and the license manager daemon is machine-independent, allowing for heterogeneous networks.</p>
