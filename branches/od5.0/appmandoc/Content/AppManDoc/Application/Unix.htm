        <p>Some remarks. Make sure you work under the same user that installed OpendTect. The 'start.vendor_name.lmgrd' scripts can be used when you have no company policy on start/stop of FlexLM daemons. The script takes one optional argument; if this argument is 'stop' then the daemon(s) will be stopped rather than started. If the 'start' mode is used, the output of the daemons is redirected to license.package_name.log.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For every commercial plugin package you should find a UNIX script 'install.package_name.license' in the installation directory that reads obtained license files and writes those to the correct position in the OpendTect tree. If you have your own FlexLM management procedures (e.g. FlexAdmin), you still have to make sure that a file 'license.package_name.dat' is present in the application directory containing the necessary license information.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The FlexLM end-user manual can be found at&#160;<a href="http://opendtect.org/images/PDF/flexnet_licensing_end_user_guide.pdf" target="_blank">http://opendtect.org/images/PDF/flexnet_licensing_end_user_guide.pdf</a></p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The two things needed by your plugin vendor to issue a license are the hostname, obtainable on UNIX with the 'hostname' command (Windows: Start-Settings-Control panel-System, tab Network identification), and the host identification. That identification can be obtained by running the FlexLM utility 'lmhostid'. After installing OpendTect, the lmhostid command can be run from the Utilities-BatchPrograms menu.</p>
