        <h2>[UNIX] <MadCap:keyword term="OpenWorks" />OpenWorks, <MadCap:keyword term="GeoFrame" />GeoFrame and <MadCap:keyword term="Petrel" />Petrel</h2>
        <p>ARK CLS maintain a series of plugins accessing the mainstream platforms commonly used in the industry. The ARKCLS <MadCap:keyword term="WorkStation Access" />WorkStation Access (WSA) plugin is commonly used for import and export SeisWorks or GeoFrame data directly. There is also a Petrel/OceanView access plugin. The WSA servers support OpenWorks R2003 and R5000, and GeoFrame 4.0-4.4.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To use these plugins, OpendTect needs to be started from a properly prepared environment. Essentially, OpenWorks, GeoFrame or Petrel must also be runnable in that environment. The startup script will check for this - For OpenWorks, the&#160;<i>OWHOME</i>&#160;variable is checked, for GeoFrame,&#160;<i>GF_PATH</i>. The full initialization and checking sequence can be found (if the plugin is installed) in odinit.arkcls. Starting OpendTect from a GeoFrame or OpenWorks xterm is recommended.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You will need one or more licenses for the WSA and POA connections.</p>
