        <h3>Multi-Machine Batch Processing on Windows</h3>
        <p>Running Multi-Machine batch processing on Windows requires few pre-configurable steps, like adding the list and specifications of the remote hosts to the batch hosts file, sharing the survey folder, and starting the remote_processing service daemon on each of these remote host machines. All these steps are clarified below.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>On Windows we assume that the survey folder (DataRoot) is on a central server and the user works from a workstation (local host) along with some other machines connected to the network which can be used as remote hosts for processing. The survey folder has to be shared and mapped on each of the host machine. Then install OpendTect on all the hosts and start the daemon service (which comes with the installation) in each of them. In case of local host machine the daemon is not needed. Create the "BatchHosts" file on the local host which contains information about remote host's IP-address/host names and the mapped survey folder corresponding to each of the machines. All these sections are explained below in details.</p>
