        <p>The 3D graphical engine of OpendTect 5.0 and higher is based upon the open-source visualization library OpenSceneGraph (<a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openscenegraph.org</a>). This package in turn relies on a proper installation of OpenGL to do its work. Some features of OpendTect, like stereo viewing, are only available if the OpenGL implementation supports it. The OpenGL version required is 1.2 or higher on all platforms.</p>

        <p>All mainstream graphical cards are nowadays delivered with OpenGL drivers for windows. High-end ATI Radeon- and nVidia-based cards are very well up to the task. Those cards work nicely under Linux, too. Unfortunately, most Intel chipsets will not be usable. For more information, consult the <a href="http://opendtect.org/lic/doc/system_requirements.html" target="_blank">system requirements</a>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Make sure you&#160;<b>update the drivers</b>&#160;at least every half year (also on Linux!). This is essential. Not doing it can and will cause all sorts of problems for the users, from small details, through major display issues, to all-out crashes.</p>
