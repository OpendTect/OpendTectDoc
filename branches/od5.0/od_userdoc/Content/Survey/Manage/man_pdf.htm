        <h3>Manage Probability Density Functions</h3>
        <p>The window allows to manage Probability Density Functions. PDF may be <a href="../Import/imp_pdfs.htm" target="_self">imported</a>, <a href="../../anal/xplot/xplot_pdf.htm" target="_self">extracted from crossplots</a> or <a href="gen_pdfs.htm" target="_self">generated</a>  with user-defined specifications. Main uses of PDF in OpendTect are <a href="../../proc/create_seis_output/bayes_clss.htm" target="_self">Bayesian Classification</a> and stochastic pseudowell modeling  in SynthRock.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>PDFs can also be exported for external use.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>PDFs can be discrete or continuous. A discrete PDF can have up to 3 dimensions, while continuous PDF is not limited by number of dimensions. The example above shows a discrete PDF with 3 dimensions, each taken from a well log. The icons on the right hand side allow to perform the following actions, respectively from top to bottom: Rename, Lock/Unlock, Remove, Set as default, Browse/Edit and Generate PDF.</p>

        <p>By clicking on   <img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/editprdf.png" class="Icons" />in the Manage PDFs window PDF may be edited with respect to the names of the variables (<i>Names</i> tab, left), or in the table showing the stored values (<i>Values</i> tab, right). Changes applied in any of the two tabs will be saved only when pressing OK button. A popup window will give the choice to overwrite, save as new or cancel changes.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The first icon right of the table (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/viewprdf.png" class="Icons" />) launches a 2D viewer that displays the values seen in the table. If the PDF has 3 dimensions, the  left and right arrows may be used to navigate through the bins of the third variable with increasing and decreasing values respectively.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The second icon right of the table   (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Icons/smoothcurve.png" class="Icons" />) performs smoothing of the PDF data. Weighted average of a central sample with 1/2 weight and N neighbouring samples (excluding diagonal neighbours) each with 1/2N weight is calculated at every bin, where N=2, 4 and 6 for 1D, 2D and 3D PDF. This smoothing is rather gentle, and can be repeated multiple times for a more pronounced effect.</p>
