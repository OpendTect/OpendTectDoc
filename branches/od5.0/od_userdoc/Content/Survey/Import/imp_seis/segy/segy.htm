        <h4>SEG-Y</h4>
        <p>SEG-Y is the standard way to share volumes/lines of data. In OpendTect the files are loaded with a rigorous respect to the <a href="http://www.seg.org/resources/publications/misc/technical-standards" target="_blank">SEG standards</a> using a loading wizard. Most SEG-Y files will be imported in a few clicks, and a number of exceptions can be set to load the most problematic data. Nevertheless there are a few guidelines that must be honoured:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The traces must be sorted either by inlines and then crosslines or by crosslines and then inlines.</li>
            <li>The gathers of pre-stack data must be consecutive and ordered by increasing offset (i.e. no common offset sorting).</li>
            <li>Inline/crosslines or coordinates (and offset) must be written in every single trace header. Separate navigation data is not supported.</li>
            <li>The traces must have a fixed length.</li>
            <li>There is no support of extended textual headers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once the above criteria are respected, you will then enjoy a large freedom:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaps can be present.</li>
            <li>The traces can start at any time/depth, even negative.</li>
            <li>The files can be merged during import, re-scaled using linear equations,and the storage format can be changed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
