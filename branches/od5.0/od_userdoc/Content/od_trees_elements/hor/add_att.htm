        <h3>Add Attribute</h3>
        <p>This allows choosing the data to display on the horizon from stored cubes, a calculated attribute from the current attribute set, or horizon data that were included with the horizon already. For Horizon data a dialog will popup where you can select multiple data files. After loading you can browse through the data by pressing the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' buttons on your keyboard.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><b>Note:</b> for PgUP &amp; PgDn to work, the mouse pointer must be in the scene.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once a horizon is added (with its Z-values displayed in the scene), it is possible to also right-click on '<i>Z-values</i>' in the tree to give you other options:</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Furthermore, once a horizon has an attribute displayed, it is also possible to '<i>Save as Horizon Data</i>'... and will be visible in the '<i><a href="../../Survey/Manage/man_hors/hor_man_3d.htm" target="_self">Manage 3D Horizons</a></i>' window:</p>
