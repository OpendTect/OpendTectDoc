        <h1>Semblance</h1>
        <p><b>Name</b>
        </p>
        <p>Semblance -- Attribute that returns a value (semblance coefficient) which is a measure of multichannel coherence.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Description</b>
        </p>
        <p>Semblance is, essentially, a measure of how similar a particular trace is to a group of traces within a user-defined correlation window. This attribute will calculate the semblance coefficient and return a value between 0 (completely dissimilar) and 1 (identical). This is done by summing the squares of the energies within the stack and dividing by the sum of those energies.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note">Whereas the <a href="sim.htm" target="_popup">Similarity</a> attribute works by comparing pairs in given positions, Semblance uses all points within the window to create the score.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Input Parameters</b>
        </p>
        <p>The size of the correlation window is defined by the Time Gate and Stepout, with the 'Extension' defining its shape. </p>
        <p>Steering may be used to enhance the results, if the <a href="http://opendtect.org/index.php/products/commercial-products/dip-steering" target="_popup">DipSteering plugin</a> is installed (with a valid license.)</p>

            <p><b>Time-Gate:</b>
            </p>
            <p>Defines the  size of the vertical element in the correlation window (ie: the trace length to be used in the calculation).</p>

            <ul>
                <li><i>None:</i> Semblance is calculated using only the traces defined in 'Trace positions'.</li>
                <li><i>Mirror 90 degrees:</i> Semblance is calculated using two additional traces: the defined trace pair (as in 'None') and  the trace obtained by 90° rotation. (Not available for 2D data)</li>
                <li><i>Mirror 180 degrees:</i> Semblance is calculated using two additional traces: the defined trace pair (as in 'None') and  the trace obtained by 180° degree rotation. </li>
                <li><i>Full Block:</i> Semblance is calculated using all possible traces in the column defined by the time-gate/step-out. Beware of potentially long processing times with large time-gates/stepouts.</li>
                <li><i>Cross:</i> Semblance is calculated using all possible traces in the '+' -shaped column bounded by the time-gate/step-out.</li>
                <li><i>All Directions:</i> Semblance is calculated using all possible traces in the '✴' -shape bounded by time-gate/step-out. This is the extension found to be most useful: it gives a degree of accuracy almost equal to that of 'Full Block' but with significantly less processing time (depending on the step-out, up to a factor of 10).</li>
                <li><i>Diagonal:</i> Semblance is calculated using all possible traces in the 'x' -shaped column bounded by the time-gate/step-out.</li>
