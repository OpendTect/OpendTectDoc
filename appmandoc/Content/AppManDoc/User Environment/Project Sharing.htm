        <p>OpendTect projects can be shared by many users. The only real obstacle in practice would be the access permissions. There are two main strategies to get this right:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure the users belong to a common (work-)group, and (on UNIX) set their umask so that files are created with group write permission by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create (a) special user id(s) for OpendTect projects. The different users can then work under the same Operating system user ID. For this strategy to work, an additional environment variable needs to be set:&#160;DTECT_USER. OpendTect will automatically use other settings and allow different projects for the same userID depending on the setting of <i>$DTECT_USER</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The latter strategy has been used at dGB for years. At login under our 'cases' user, the user is prompted to type his/her name, which is then used to set the&#160;<i>DTECT_USER</i>&#160;environment variable.</p>
