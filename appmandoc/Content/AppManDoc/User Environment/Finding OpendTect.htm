        <h2>Finding OpendTect</h2>
        <p>For installations on platforms other than Windows, users will have to be able to find OpendTect. There is no procedure initiated by the OpendTect installation to put the start-up scripts in the user's path. Whether you want to put <span style="font-family: 'Miriam Fixed';">start_dtect</span> in their path at login, or set an alias for it, create a desktop link - or even other solutions, is simply not something we take care of. Note that this is one of the reasons why OpendTect need not be (and should preferably not be) installed by root.</p>
