        <h4>Windows</h4>
        <p>The normal way to specify a FlexLM license file on Windows is to simply start OpendTect. If you did not specify a license file yet, OpendTect will ask for one. Simply follow the instructions on the screen. Sometimes, this doesn't work (for example if you want to use another license file). Then you can use the FlexLM utility program available in the Windows start menu for OpendTect: <MadCap:keyword term="License Manager Tools" />'License Manager Tools' (LMTOOLS.exe).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Everything should be manageable from this program, although things can be a little confusing. If you need to install on a Windows server, you should really take a look at </p>

        <p>The main choice you have is whether you need to install using services or with a license file. Which of the two depends on the license file you have got and the machine you are on. If you have a node-locked license, you always have to choose to set up using a license file. Also demo licenses (where HOSTID=DEMO) and machines that are not designated to be SERVER of a floating license. In the start tab, select 'Configuration using License file'. You can then select the file to use, but that often doesn't work. Then go to the 'Utilities' tab and enter Vendor Name dgbld and select the path to the license file. Then press 'Override Path'.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If you have a floating license, you must start the service on the machine mentioned in the header of the license file. On that machine, start the License manager Tools. In the start tab, select 'Configuration using services'. Then click the 'Config Services' tab (which has now appeared). Enter a name for the service, for example 'OD-dGB lic man'. Confusing here is that the combo box is an editable field. You have to find the path to the lmgrd.exe. This may be vendor-specific, for example, dGB has all license-related files in a directory: <i>C:\Program Files\OpendTect\5.0.0\bin\win64\lm.dgb</i> The path to the license file is something you have chosen yourself (for example in <i>C:\Licenses</i>), and the normally the debug log file can be placed in the same directory. Now, you can press the '<i>Save service</i>' button. Then, you can start the service in the <i>Start/Stop/Reread</i> tab. If you want to run OpendTect from another computer, you need to copy the license file to that computer, and use the same utility. Now, go to the '<i>Utilities</i>' tab and enter Vendor Name dgbld and select the path to the license file. Then press '<i>Override Path</i>'. That should be enough to make the computer find the license manager service on the remote machine.</p>

        <p>For simple node-locked and demo licenses, there is also a menu in OpendTect, for end-users. Instructions for node-locked and demo licenses can be found here: </p>
