        <h3>Installation Scripts and <MadCap:keyword term="INSTALL.txt" />INSTALL.txt</h3>
        <p>In INSTALL.txt, the installation procedure is described. On Windows, you need to download one or more self-extracting executables. On UNIX-type systems, you may have to download a script: <span style="font-family: 'Miriam Fixed';">install.od</span> or <span style="font-family: 'Miriam Fixed';">inst_pkgs.od</span>. All scripts take no arguments and should be easy to complete. Please read INSTALL.txt carefully.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Regarding the selection of installation directory, you should choose a directory that is accessible on all machines that will run OpendTect (or one of its batch programs). This is especially important for multi-machine processing (which is indispensable for surveys of considerable size). Every machine that needs to be used for this multi-machine processing needs to be able to access OpendTect under the same directory name.</p>
