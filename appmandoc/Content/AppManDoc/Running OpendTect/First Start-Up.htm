        <h2>First Start-Up</h2>
        <p>There are a couple of considerations on first start-up:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>The <MadCap:keyword term="Data Access Point" />Data Access Point</b>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This will be $DTECT_DATA</p>
        <p>Installation of OpendTect usually means making available a base directory from which the project data can be reached. The location of this directory can be set in the user's environment as DTECT_DATA, although, especially on Windows, this will usually be done 'behind the scenes' through a user setting ('Default DATA directory').</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Anyway, the DTECT_DATA directory must be:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>reachable from every machine that needs to access the data</li>
            <li>accessible for the users for read/write</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(See&#160;<a href="../Data Storage/DTECT_DATA - the data access point.htm" target="_self">DTECT_DATA</a>)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><b>Licenses</b>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>On first start-up (for example following (re-)installation), you will be prompted to install license(s). It is vital to ensure that they are correctly installed and findable.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>There are other ways to achieve this same result:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soft link: Place the license in the root of the installation directory or make a link there to where the license is located.</li>
            <li>Set up an environment variable: LM_LICENSE_FILE=port@host (for multiple entries use port@host1:port@host2:port@hostetc)</li>
            <li>In Windows you see a pop-up on start up for dGB (and on usage for the ArkCLS and SITFAL plugins) asking you to specify the license server system (this needs to be done as Administrator to set this for all users).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In the License file you may change the host name and add a port number or port@host to the right-hand side of the Mac address (though you may not change the Mac address). For example:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="font-family: 'Miriam Fixed';">SERVER myodtserver 00145ebc6210 3456@host</span>
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Note that this needs to be done for both the server's and the client(s) license file(s).</p>
        <p>Using this last option (set port@host) is very useful when circumventing Firewall issues.</p>
