        <h2>[UNIX] The Environment</h2>
        <p>The environment for the programs is set in the following sequence (see bin/init_dtect):</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>General initialization, e.g.&#160;DTECT_APPL&#160;and possibly&#160;DTECT_DATA&#160;are set.</li>
            <li>LD_LIBRARY_PATH&#160;and&#160;PATH&#160;are extended with one directory. In some installations, this has been a problem because Landmark adds an incredible amount of directories to the&#160;PATH. We think it is not unreasonable to require the ability of adding one single directory to the executable path. Therefore, we leave it to the system administrators to shorten the&#160;PATH&#160;to allow at least the OpendTect binary directory to be added to the path.</li>
            <li>The initialization scripts for the plugin packages are automatically sourced by init_dtect.</li>
        </ul>
