        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>There are a number of requirements to be able to run OpendTect. First of all, OpendTect will not start without a proper OpenGL installation, which foremost and above all means good, recent drivers. Furthermore, some minimal, reasonable preconditions must be met (see&#160;<a href="[UNIX] The Environment.htm">environment</a>). Lastly, some plugins have their own requirements. For example, a proper SeisWorks or GeoFrame installation is required for the ArkCls WorkStation Access plugin.</p>
