        <h4>Mapping Survey Folder</h4>
        <p>It is assumed that the survey folder is in a server which has to be shared and mapped on all host machines to be used for multi-machine processing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the survey folder is on the C drive on the server e.g. <i>C:\Surveys</i> then map the C drive from this machine to other host machines by choosing an available drive letter ( like <i>C:</i>, <i>D:</i> <i>S:</i> etc). So the survey folder now becomes <i>S:\Surveys</i> or <i>F:\Surveys</i> on each of the machines depending on drive letter that is used.</p>
