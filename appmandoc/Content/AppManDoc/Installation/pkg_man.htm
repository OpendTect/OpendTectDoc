        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The last window of the wizard is the OpendTect Package Manager (see above figure). Multiple items can be selected from the list by checking the boxes (or not). Optionally, the relevant package combination could also be selected from the top list box.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The installation manager will automatically recognize the previously installed version at the selected path and will prompt it in the&#160;<i>Installed version</i>&#160;field.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>To read more about a particular item in the list, select the item by clicking on it and read the description on to the right panel. For example, Dip-Steering:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/06_pkg_man_ds_xmpl.png" class="PDF_Images" />
        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="note"> If, for any reason, you should choose to abort the installation mid-download, you will see the following window appear:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/inst_man_abort_inst.png" class="PDF_Images" />
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This gives you various options, including increasing the time-out from its default setting, changing the download server or changing the <a href="con_setts.htm" target="_self">Proxy settings</a>.</p>
